            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſame thing happens to me, about to ſpeak of Fermentation, that once did to a Famous Hiſtorian, when he wrote his Commentary of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, to wit, whilſt he endeavoured to draw forth, as it were in a little Table, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs only of that Nation, he was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated not only to recount the Actions of one people, but of all man-kind: in like manner, whilſt I did meditate on a few things only concerning the energy, and the means of the working of Ferments, I have brought into this Tract, as it were ſwelled up with a certain Ferment, the whole Proviſion, and Dowry of all Nature. Entring upon this Diſquiſition, I thought I had been tyed only to the Bakers Oven, and Brewers Furnace, being condemned to the Mill, not to have proceeded beyond their limits, unleſs by chance, or with leave; but after that I had begun to look more deeply into the matter, I perceived I had gotten a far more large Province: Becauſe it plainly appeared, beſides theſe of Art, very many Works of Nature, to be not only like, but themſelves the effects of Fermentation: For when, for the ſolving of the Phoenomenas, which are met with about the ſwelling up of the mealy Maſs, and the working of Wine, and of other Liquors, I had Compoſed divers Arguments, Reaſons, and Hypotheſes, I found at length, thoſe firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Particles, by whoſe Orgaſm or Heat, thoſe vulgar preparations do Ferment, to beget the Cauſes of motions, and alterations, in whatever things they are mix'd with beſides; wherefore, I may be pardoned, if I have ſtrayed far from our propoſition, and have ſeemed to any one, to have heaped together here, too plentiful an Harveſt of Matter, becauſe I was wholly led by the ſame thrid of Ratiocination, and the moſt conjunct Affinity of things, to theſe various and diverſe Concretes. If any one ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb facs="tcp:107016:4"/>that I proſtitute the unuſual Notions, and almoſt only heard of, in the Shops of the Chymiſts, unhandſomly among the works of ordinary people, I ſay, theſe Principles, which being brought indeed to perform the ſelf moving motions of Natural things, alſo more eaſily to repreſent them to the vulgar capacity, and lay them not only before their Eyes, but even into their very Hands; what of theſe kind of ſubſtances, I call Particles, men tho rude and unskilful, may perceive even by the help of their ſenſes to be in the things: beſides the names of Sulphur, Salt, and Spirit, and the reſt, are more familiarly known, than Matter, and Form, or the four Principles of the <hi>Peripateticks.</hi> As to our method, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Philoſophizing, no man can blame me, if I ſhould not here deſcribe all things according to Rule, and Analytick Patterns; becauſe in this Work, it chances for me to wander, without a Guide, or Companion, in ſolitary places, and as it were in a ſolitude trodden by no footſteps, where I not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a Journey, but my way alſo: therefore, when ever I deviate, I cannot be ſaid to err, among right Judges of our endeavours, who have no Path in which I ſhould Walk, nor could find a Track, which I might fear to miſs.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is nothing more rarely to be met with, in the Vulgar Philoſophy, where Natural things are unfolded, with the vain figments of Forms and Qualities, than the word <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation:</hi> but among the more ſound (eſpecially of later years) who reſpect the Matter and Motion chiefly in Bodies, nothing is almoſt more uſual. But Fermentation hath its name from Ferveſcency, as Ferment from Ferviment or grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot. The word is well known in making of Bread, and in the purgings of new Wine, Beer, and other potable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors: thence it is alſo applyed to other things, which are wont to ſwell or grow turgid, after the ſame manner: that at length it ſignifies, whatſoever Effervency or Turgency, that is raiſed up in a Natural Body, by particles of that Body variouſly agitated.</p>
                     <p>Bodies of a divers Conſiſtency and Habitude, are apt to a Fermenting, <hi>viz.</hi> either Thin or Thick, Liquid or Solid, Animate or Inanimate, Natural or Artificial; in all which is found an Heterogeneity of parts or particles, to wit, there are in them ſome ſubſtances light, and always endeavouring to fly away: and alſo there are others thick, earthy, and more fix'd, which intangle the ſubtil Particles, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein them in their Embraces, whilſt they endeavour to fly away; from the ſtrivings, and wreſtlings of theſe two twins, in one Womb, the motion of Fermentation chiefly proceeds; but on the contrary, what things do not Ferment, for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of like Particles, and are of the ſame Figure and Conformation, which indeed conſociat among themſelves, without any Tumult or Turgeſcency, lye quiet, and enjoy a deep peace. If Muſt, or new Wine, or new Ale or Beer, be cloſely Bottl'd up, or put into Veſſels of ſmall vent, they will grow ſo very hot, that often the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are in danger of breaking. But if the ſame Liquors, being Diſtilled by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and then what is ſeperated ſhut up, from thence no motion or heat will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Wherefore, Diſtilled Waters, hot Spirits, Oyls, fixed Salts of Herbs, and very many other more ſimple preparations of the Chymiſts, remain a long while
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:107016:6"/>without any alteration or Fermentation, Perhaps ſome of the Particles do evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, but the reſt do not tumultuate. In the mean time the juice and blood of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables or Animals, as alſo all Liquors Concreted, and compounded of may things quickly Ferment, and from thence enter into divers turns of changes. The Spirit of Wine being cloſely ſhut up in a Phial ſhews no ſign of growing hot, but if but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Oyl of Turpentine be added to this Spirit, the Particles of the Liquor will ſo leap forth, that I have ſeen it break a Glaſs Hermetically Sealed. All Diſtilled Waters of Herbs, ſo they be kept ſimply in a Glaſs, will remain incorrupt a long time, but if you add to the ſame Sugar or Syrrup, it preſently grows ſoure and is corrupted: Wherefore, that the Fermentation of Bodies may be rightly unfolded, we muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what thoſe Particles or Subſtances are, and of what Nature of which mixt things are Compounded, and from thoſe being put together, and mutual ſtrivings, motions for the moſt part naturally proceed.</p>
                     <p>Altho there be many and divers Opinions of Philoſophers concerning the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of Natural things, yet there are three chiefly deſerve our Aſſent, and Faith, before the reſt. That famous fourfold Chariot of the Peripateticks obtains the chief place, which emulous of the four wheel'd Coach of the Sun, is hurried by a quick paſſage, through the fictitious Heaven of the firſt Matter, and meaſures that vaſt and empty thing, with a perpetual reciprocation. For they ſay, all things are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted out of Water, Air, Fire, and Earth; and that out of the divers tranſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe, Generation and Corruption, as alſo the changes of all alterations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, do ariſe. In the ſecond place, and next, ſtands the Opinion of <hi>Democritus</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> which lately alſo hath been revived in our Age, this affirms all Natural effects to depend upon the Conflux of Atoms diverſly figured, ſo that in all Bodies, there be Particles Round, Sharp, Fourſquare, Cylindrical, Chequer'd or Streaked, or of ſome other Figure; and from the divers changes of theſe, the Subject is of this or that Figure, Work, or Efficacy. The third Opinion of the Origination of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Things, is introduced by Chymiſtry, which, when by an Analyſis made by Fire, it reſolves all Bodies into Particles of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, affirms by the beſt right, that the ſame do conſiſt of theſe. Becauſe this Hypotheſis determinates Bodies into ſenſible parts, and cutts open things as it were to the life, it pleaſes us before the reſt.</p>
                     <p>As to the four Elements, and firſt Qualities from thence deduced, I muſt confeſs that this Opinion doth ſomething help for the unfolding the Phaenomena of Nature, but after ſo dark a manner, and without any peculiar reſpect to the more ſecret receſſes of Nature, it ſalves the appearances of things, that 'tis almoſt the ſame thing, to ſay an Houſe conſiſts of Wood and Stone, as a Body of four Elements. The other Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which is only a piece of the <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophy, foraſmuch as it undertakes Mechanically the unfolding of things, and accommodates Nature with Working Tools, as it were in the hand of an Artificer, and without running to Occult Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Sympathy, and other refuges of ignorance, doth happily and very ingeniouſly diſintangle ſome difficult Knots of the Sciences, and dark Riddles, certainly it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no light praiſe: but becauſe it rather ſuppoſes, than demonſtrates it Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and teaches of what Figure thoſe Elements of Bodies may be, not what they have been, and alſo induces Notions extremly ſubtil, and remote from the ſenſe, and which do not ſufficiently Quadrate with the Phaenomena of Nature, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to particulars, it pleaſes me to give my ſentence for the third Opinion before-mentioned, which is of the Chymiſts, and chiefly to inſiſt upon this in the following Tract, to wit, affirming all Bodies to conſiſt of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, and from the diverſe motion, and proportion of theſe, in mixt things, the beginnings and endings of things, and chiefly the reaſons, and varieties of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are to be ſought. If any one ſhall object, That the Atomical, and our Spagyric Principles, are altogether ſubordinate, to wit, that theſe, tho at the laſt ſenſible, are reſolved into thoſe, only to be ſignified by Conception; I ſhall not much gainſay him, ſo it ſhews that thoſe Conceptions are real. I being dul and purblind, leave the more accurate to quick ſights, being content to be ſo wiſe as to perform the buſineſs of the outward Senſe with Reaſon: for I profeſs, it pleaſes not me, to deviſe or dream Philoſophy. But that our Work may more rightly proceed, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, to ſpeak firſt a few things of theſe kind of Principles in general, and of thier Affections.</p>
                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:107016:6"/>
                     <p>I mean by the name of Principles, not ſimple and wholly uncompounded Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but ſuch kind of Subſtances only, into which Phyſical things are reſolved, as it were into parts, laſtly ſenſible. By the inteſtine motion, and combination of theſe, Bodies are begot, and increaſe: by the mutual departure and diſſolution of theſe one from another, they are altered, and periſh. In the mean time, what Particles are gathered together in the ſubjects, or depart away from them, will appear under the form of Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, or of one of the reſt.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> A deſcription of the Principles of Chymiſts, and the Properties and Affections of them.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. SPirits are Subſtances highly ſubtil, and Aetherial Particles of a more Divine Breathing, which our Parent Nature hath hid in this Sublunary World, as it were the Inſtruments of Life and Soul, of Motion and Senſe, of every thing; whilſt they of their own Nature are always enlarged, and endeavouring to fly away, leſt they ſhould too ſoon leave their ſubjects, they are bound ſomtimes with more thick Particles, that by entring into them, and by ſubtilizing them, and variouſly unfolding them, they diſpoſe the ſubſtance to maturity, as is to be obſerved in the Vegetation, and Fermentation of Bodies; ſomtimes being reſtrained within ſome ſpaces, to wit, the Veſſels or Bowel of living Creatures, they are compelled more often to repeat the ſame meaſures of their motions for the performing the works of Life, Senſe and Motion. From the motion of theſe proceed the animation of Bodies, the growth of Plants, and the ripening of Fruits, Liquors, and other prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; they determinate the Form and Figure of every thing, prefixed as it were by Divine deſignation: they conſerve the bonds of the mixture by their preſence; and open them, by their departure, at their pleaſure: they bridle the irregularities of Sulphur and Salt. The perfection and ſtate of every thing conſiſts in the plenty and exaltation of Spirits, and the fall and declination, in their want and defect.</p>
                     <p>As to the Subjects in which the Spirits are: Minerals becauſe they are of a more fixed nature, wanting Motion and Vegetation, are almoſt without Spirits, or at leaſt are contented with a few. For the birth and growth of Vegetables, they are required in a more moderate quantity. In the Conſtitution of a living Creature, where there is greater Uſe of Spirits, for Senſe and Motion, a far more plentiful quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity is found. In the works of Art, and chiefly in thoſe which aſcend to perfection, by Digeſtion and Fermentation, there are found to be a ſufficiently great proportion of Spirits: but in all ſubjects whatſoever, whilſt the immerſed Spirits are mingled with the other Principles, their condition or ſtate comes under a threefold conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for they are either depreſſed and ſcattered, and ſo involved with more thick Particles, that they are very little ſeen, or ſhew forth their powers, as in things undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, crude and unripe, may be perceived, in which the Spirits can hardly extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate themſelves into motion, and from which they can hardly be drawn by Diſtillation. Or ſecondly, the Spirits flying forth from the thick ſubſtance of the reſt, are full of vigor, ſhake and rightly diſpoſe the more groſs Particles, ſubtilize the thick, digeſt the crude, and bring things to the ſteme or height of maturity and perfection: or laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Spirits having obtained the height of things, do luxuriate and make excurſions out of the Body: hence thoſe that remain, are by degrees leſſened of their plenty and ſtrength, until being leſs in power than the Particles of the Salts and Sulphur, they are put under their yoak, and by little and little are deſtroyed and driven away out of the Subject; on this threefold ſtate depends the beginnings or rudiments, the maturity and exaltation, and the defect and end of things.</p>
                     <p>It is obſerved, when the Spiritous Latex is drawn forth of any Liquor by Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the vapor or ſteam is not elevated into dew, that is, come together in lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle drops or dew, every where poured forth, as it is wont to do in watery things; but
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:107016:7"/>it is divided into ſtreaks, and many little rivulets, and renders the Alembic mark'd in every part, with ſtraight lines, only not meridional, leading from the Centre of the top, to the brim of the Circumference. The cauſe of which ſeems to be this, to wit, ſince that the ſpirituous ſubſtance is very ſubtil, it is not eaſily Collected into Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor; neither is it fixed every where about the ſides of the Veſſel, in its aſcent, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery Liquors; but always ſtretches further, and unleſs when it comes to the top it ſelf of the little head, doth in no wiſe ſtay, but there the ſpirituous breath, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained as it were in a punct, and being brought backward, it begins to gather into dew: wherefore, from that top, as it were the Fountain, the Spirits flowing forth on every ſide by ſtreams, deſcend in ſtreaks towards the mouth or brim of the Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic. And when thoſe lines wholly diſappear, it is a ſign, that the ſpirituous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is quite ſtill'd forth, and that the watery breath only aſcends.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, Sulphur is a Principle of a little thicker conſiſtency than Spirit, after that, the moſt active: for when the Spirits firſt break forth from the looſned ſubſtance of the mixture, preſently the Sulphureous Particles endeavour to follow. The Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every thing, as to Heat, Conſiſtency, and amiable frame or contexture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends chiefly on Sulphur; from hence alſo for the moſt part ariſe, variety of Colours and Odors, the faimeſs and deformity of the Body, alſo the diverſity of taſtes. In the Boſom of this the Spirits immediately in which as in a Copula, they are united, by the more hard embraces of the reſt. The ſubſtance of Sulphur, though leſs ſubtil, is yet of more firceneſs and unrulineſs than the Spirits are, for this unleſs it be reſtrained, by the embrace of the others, as it were in bonds, and its Particles be detained one from another by the interjection or coming between of the reſt, not only leaves the ſubject, but deſtroys it ſelf, with too impetuous an eruption. Indeed the little bodies of this being gently moved, do cauſe digeſtion, and maturation, ſweetneſs, and many perfective qualities in things: being a little more ſtrongly moved, they induce heat, and an exceſs of qualities, inordinations, and chiefly a ſtinking ſavour: but being more impetuouſly moved or ſtirred up, they bring in the diſſolution of Bodies, yea a flame and Burning.</p>
                     <p>The ſubſtance of Sulphur is never ſeen ſincere, yea it conſiſts not of it ſelf from others, but vaniſhes away into Air: its Particles being concreted and chained together, with Salt and Earth, are fixed as it were immoveable, as is ſeen in Metals and ſome Stones: or being Diluted with Spirit and Water, and temper'd together with the reſt, exiſt in motion, by which means (as was before ſaid of Spirit) they are in a threefold ſtate, within the ſubſtance of the mixture: for either firſt of all its little bodies being involved with Salt and Earth, or too much drenched with a watery hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, are obſcured, ſo that they exerciſe but little of virtue, from whence the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid and cold temper of things exiſts, their qualities are Obtuſe, Dull, and of ſmall virtue or force, and the Bodies leſs apt to be inflamed, as is diſcerned in unripe Fruit, raw Juices and green Wood. Or ſecondly, The Particles of Sulphur begin to ſhine forth with Spirit, to be more thickly heaped or rolled together, and to appear eminent above the reſt of the Principles. And ſo by its motion, they evaporate the ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous moiſture, digeſt Crudities, and induce a warm temper in things, active qualities, a lively force and maturation, or ripeneſs: which kind of exaltation of Sulphur may be obſerved in Wine and Liquors long Fermented, in ripe Fruits, in the Youth and florid Conſtitution of living Creatures. Or thirdly, The Sulphureous Partickles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gathered into vigor, grow too hot, looſe the bonds of mixture, and deſire to fly away; and from their diverſe manner of departure and ſeparation, the diſſolution of Bodies variouſly happens: For either they evaporate with Water and Spirit, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and without tumult, and leave their ſubjects lean and dry, which, when the Sulphur is wholy gon, fall into Aſhes: Or ſecondly, in Bodis which abound with Sulphur, when the mixture is looſned, and the Spirits begin to fly away, the remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Particles of Sulphur are wont to be very much moved, and to grow exceeding hot; and being ſhut up in a thick ſubſtance, are gathered together more nearly, (as in Dung and Hay growing hot) and conceive heat, and ſomtimes Burning: breaking forth after this manner, by heaps, and impetuouſly, they breath out a ſtinking ſmell, and bring on a rottenneſs to the ſubject. There is a third manner of eruption, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Sulphureous Particles go forth of Bodies, when they withdraw themſelves, as it were with violence, and being gathered together, break forth into fire and flame: whereby indeed becoming unbridled and untamed, they break all bars or lets, and wholly deſtroy the ſubſtance or frame of the Subject: By this means, by their own and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:107016:7"/>proper efferveſcency they procure a Burning, as when they being layed up wet, or the wheels of Carts, or Axeltree, made hot by motion doe fire, or becauſe Sulphur is inkindled by Sulphur: for its Particles being impetuouſly moved, ſhake or move all that's near them, and carry them into the like motion of Conflagration, as ſhall be more fully ſhown hererfter, when we ſhall diſcourſe concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of fire.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Salt is of a little more fixed nature, than either Spirit of Sulphur, nor ſo apt to fly away; but beſtows a Compaction and Solidity on things, and alſo weight and duration, It retards the diſſolution of Bodies, and promotes Congelations and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulations, and very much reſiſts Putrefaction, Corruption, and Inflammation; to wit, foraſmuch as it fixes the too volatile Sulphur and Spirit, and detains them in a Body: wherefore ponderous Woods, Stones, Metals, and what abound in Salt, are hardly enkindled, and remain a long while free from Corruption. Not only the duration of the individual, but alſo the propagation of the Species, depends ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much upon the Principle of Salt, becauſe the fertility of the Earth, the growth of Plants, and eſpecially the frequent faetation, and bringing forth of young, in living Creatures, takes their Original from the Saltiſh Seed: hence it is, that <hi>Venus</hi> is ſaid to ariſe from the Sea, and Luſt is called Salacity. For Salt having obtained a flux, gathers together, and ſtirs up into motion, the idle, or too much disjoyned little Bodies of Spirit or Sulphur, and excellently keeps them together with itſelf, for the producing the firſt ground-work of things.</p>
                     <p>Salt within the frame of the mixture, is either altogether fixed, when its Particles being almoſt deſtitute of Spirit and Water, but bound together with Earth, or Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, or both of them, grow into Stones, Metals, of Minerals of another kind; which fixity in Nature is imitated in making Glaſs, and Earthen Ware: or Salt is looſned from its fixedneſs, to wit, when its Particles being mixed with the other Principles, and chiefly with Spirit and Sulphur, and Diluted with Water do unfold themſelves, and being diffuſed through the mixture, do Ferment with the reſt: whilſt the little Bodies of the Salt are after this manner put into motion, there is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved of them a threefold State or Condition, to wit, of Fuſion, Volatiliſation, and Fluxation.</p>
                     <p>I call the State of Fuſion, when the little Bodies of the Salt being Commixed with the reſt, begin as to their ſmalleſt parts to be diſſolved, and diffuſed, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated here and there, through the whole ſubſtance of the mixture, as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Germination of Plants, in the firſt Conceptions of living Creatures, and in the beginnings of Fermentations; hence Spring only a rude and indige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted formation of things, an ingrateful ſavour, and for the moſt part bitter of biting.</p>
                     <p>From theſe firſt Rudiments of Motions, the Saline Particles aſcend by little and little, to Vigor and Volatiliſation, together with Spirit and Sulphur: to wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they run through the whole ſubſtance of the Body, and variouſly move its matter, and diſpoſe it towards maturity. Some little Bodies ſharpen, and ſtir up into Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, others Fix, Eſtabliſh, and Congeal into a ſtony hardneſs. If there be plenty of Spirits and Sulphur, the Particles of Salt, as their handmaids, go about to unite, and aſſociate themſelves intimately with them, that they are not only ſnatched toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with them, through all the receſſes of the mixture, but (the ſubject being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Diſtillation) Salt alſo aſcends in the Alembic, even as the Spirit. From the Volatiliſation of Salt, Beauty, and Fairneſs, and ſavour chiefly ſweet, happen in things, as in the florid blood of living Creatures, in ripe Fruits, as alſo in Sugar, Milk, and Hony, we know by experience.</p>
                     <p>I mean the Fluxation of Salt, when the ſaline Particles, which being firſt gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together, with Earth, or Sulphur, of aſſociated with Spirit, and ſo remain ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated one from another, afterwards the bond of the mixtion being looſened, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wholy free, and unlooſened from the yoak of the reſt: for ſo they flow together, explicate themſelves through the whole frame of the ſubject, and whilſt Spirit and Sulphur for the moſt part fly away, theſe exerciſe a dominion over the remainder, and induce a ſoureneſs into the whole mixture: by reaſon of this Fluxation of Salt, Wine, Milk, Blood, and Eateable Things, at firſt grateful and ſweet, grow ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſoure when they begin to Corrupt; and for this Reaſon, all Salts whatſoever, having gotten a Flux, by a violent Diſtillation by Fire (that is, being driven from the Combination of Earth) grow ſour, than if the ſame ſour Liquor, be put upon the inſipid dead Head, the Whole laſtly becomes ſalted.</p>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:107016:8"/>
                     <p>Salt being deprived of the Company of the reſt, (except the Earth) becomes at laſt fixed, as is obſerved in Sea-Salt, or the incineration made of Herbs, whoſe Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſo cleave together, that they cannot be pulled aſunder by the ſtrongeſt Fire. When Vegetables are Diſtilled, ſome Saline Particles, though but few, made fit for Fuſion, aſcend with the reſt; and from thence ſome Diſtilled Waters retain a genuine ſavour of the mixture: The parts of living Creatures being expoſed to Diſtillation, yield a Volatile Salt: when Minerals, or ponderous Woods full of Salt, are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by Chymiſtry, the Diſtilled Liquor is like to Salt that hath gotten a Flux, and is very ſour.</p>
                     <p>Spirit and Sulphur eaſily unlock the ſubſtance of the mixture, and make way for themſelves; but Salt cannot, unleſs it be ſnatched forth of doors together with the Spirit it ſelf. As Spirit and Sulphur being outwardly applyed, in diſſolving or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a Body, open as it were the doors for their Companions ſhut within, ſo alſo, Salt Liquors Diſtilled, do the ſame thing. For Stygian Waters ſtrongly Corrode Metals, and are ſeen like a flame put to them, to burn and conſume the ſame.</p>
                     <p>Salt reſiſts Inflammation, for that it detains the Sulphureous Particles in its Boſom, and hinders them from breaking forth. But excepting that Sal Nitre encreaſes the burning of Sulphur, which indeed happens by accident, becauſe that Salt, as it were an Hermaphrodite, grows very turgid with Sulphureous Particles alſo, combined in the mixture; wherefore, when the Salt is melted by other fired Sulphur, the ſhut up Sulphur, breaks forth with violence, and (like a blaſt from a B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>llows) ſhakes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled fire round about, and drives more impetuouſly the ſubject into a Body: In the mean time, if your put the flame to Nitre, it will not be inkindled at all; but being put to a Sulphureous Body, it promotes its enkindling; but the other Salts, leſs turgid with Sulphureous Particles, or rather deſtitute of them, being mixed with Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, hinder its inkindling, and ſomtimes put it out.</p>
                     <p>So much for the Active Principles, which effect, as it were, the firſt ground-work of Bodies: thoſe which follow, chiefly beſtow on them Conſiſtency and Subſtance. For from hence exiſt either Liquids or Solids, Small things or Great. For Water and Earth, fill the little ſpaces that are empty, through the Combination of the reſt, with their coming between, and amplifie and enlarge the lineaments of he Body, otherwiſe too ſhort and contracted.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Water is the chiefeſt Vehicle of Spirit and Sulphur, by whoſe intervention they conſociate one with another, and with Salt; for the other Principles, being diſſolved by a watery humor, or at leaſt diluted, continue in motion, without which they grow ſtiff, as congealed things.</p>
                     <p>When Water is wanting, the active Principles meet together too ſtrictly, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually rub againſt, and conſume themſelves; and when for this reaſon, the ſuppliment of food is cut off, the Body grows withered. If humidity abounds too much, theſe Elements are eſtranged or diſſociated too much one from the other, wherefore the ſubject becomes ſluggiſh and ſlow, and of leſs efficacy, and unapt for motion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Bodies too moiſt, are lyable very much to rottenneſs and Corruption; becauſe from too much Humidity the Combination of Spirit, and Sulphur, and Salt, is too looſely effected; that they do not mutually embrace one another, nor are retained with their embracement, in the ſubject. Indeed Water abounding eaſily evaporates, and then the frame of the mixture being looſened, and the doors ſet open, Spirit and Sulphur eaſily break forth, the way being made, and leave the ſubject, as it were vapid, or made ſharp with Salt: for from hence, the infuſions of Vegitables, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coctions, Juices of Herbs, and all Liquid preparations, if the quantity of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be greater than the reſt of the Principles, and improportionate, quickly Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt.</p>
                     <p>Water is moſt eaſily drawn forth out of every thing by Diſtillation, for when Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Sulphur are often intangled with nets of Salt or Earth, they hardly let go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their embraces, and are not obedient but to a more intenſe heat, and often times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a previous Putrefaction. Water moſt eaſily, and often with no labour, is dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven out of every Body. But moſt often it ſnatches in its flying away, ſome more looſe Particles of Spirit and Sulphur, and carries them with itſelf, forth of doors.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. As the interjection of Water in Liquids, ſo of Earth in Solids, fills the empty little Spaces and Vacuities, left by the other Principles. For theſe, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the active Principles from a too ſtreight embrace, whereby they ſhould rub againſt themſelves, and cleave one to another; alſo by its thickneſs, it retains
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:107016:8"/>too Volatile things: beſides, it inlarges the due ſubſtance, and magnitude in Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>The more that Earth abounds in any thing, it is ſo much the leſs active, but of longer duration: hence Minerals endure a long while, then next the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Trees; in the mean time Animals, and the more ſlender Plants, are but of ſhort age.</p>
                     <p>In Diſtillations, Earth aſcends the Alembic, almoſt not at all, or but in a very little quantity: for the moſt part it is left, with a portion of Salt, for a <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or Dead Head; therefore it is called <hi>Terra Dammata,</hi> or damned Earth: becauſe, when the other Principles are freed, the Priſon being as it were broken, this is ſtill detained: beſides, Earth being deprived of the Company of the reſt, is of no Uſe, nor capable of change, or exaltation.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the Elements or Principles of Natural things, conſidered apart, and by themſelves. It follows, that ſome of their Affinities and Conjugations be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded: becauſe theſe very ſtrictly cohere with thoſe, and very hardly or not at all are joyned with others. Out of the mutual Combination of ſome, and diſagreement of others, various Affections ariſe, the knowledg of which gives no little Light to the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>There is a certain Kindred and Similitude of parts, between Spirit and Sulphur, which are agil or light, and eaſily to be diſſipated in both; wherefore, Spirit being driven forth of the Body, draws abundantly with it Sulphureous Particles, as is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in Spirituous Liquors Diſtilled out of any thing; to ſome of which if you mingle Water, the Liquor appears as it were troubled with precipitated Sulphur, but the Spirit without the Sulphur is undiſcernably mixed with the Water, which however by reaſon of is Volatility, may be alſo eaſily drawn away and ſeparated by Diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>Altho Spirit and Sulphur are Principles very reſembling, and (becauſe of a ready motion) either are inflameable, yet they are not one and the ſame, as is aſſerted by ſome: For Sulphur Copiouſly ſubſiſts in Bodies almoſt deſtitute of Spirit, to wit, in common Sulphur, Antimony, and other Minerals; in which its Particles are very fixed, and of their own nature almoſt immoveable, which is very far from the Nature of Spirits: For they abounding in any mixture, never lye idle, and always in motion, bring various alterations to the Subject where they dwell; then if they abound in ſtrength, they eaſily and without tumult carry themſelves forth of doors of their own accord. But Sulphur, altho it abound, doth not eaſily evaporate, but hath need of a ſtrong heat, or an actual fire, that may make a way for it; and laſtly, it breaks forth, not without a ſtink or burning: yea, if you endeavour to Diſtil Oyly and Fat things, although very Sulphureous, with a moderate Fire, they are wont to yield a Liquor only Wateriſh, and not inflameable; but if we provoke generous Wine, which ſwells with Spirit, by the gentle heat of a Bath, a moſt burning Water will Still forth, and apt wholly to be inflamed.</p>
                     <p>Spirit is not preſently joyned with Salt: For Sugar and Salts are ſcarcely diſſolved, by the rectified Spirit of Wine, but are after a manner aſſociated by a long dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion and circulation; as is perceived in the Volatile Salt of Animals, of Tincture drawn forth from the Salts of Herbs, or of Minerals, by the Spirit of Wine. If that Spirits excel in plenty, and virtue, they aſſume to themſelves, and Volatiliſe the Saline Particles. And therefore the Salt contained in the Juice or Blood of Animals, being aſſociated with Spirit is volatiliſed: alſo the Spirit of Wine, being Diſtilled by many Cohalations, with the fixed Salt of Herbs, renders it Volatile, and makes it paſs through the Alembic; but if the power of the Salt be greater, it tames the Spirit and fixes it. Hence the blood, being become Salt, by means of an ill dyet, becomes leſs Spirituous. Fixed Salts, and the Oyl of Vitriol fix the Spirits, grown too volatile, and unbridled; and Coagulate the Spirit of Wine it ſelf.</p>
                     <p>But Sulphur is a more fit ſubject of the Spirit, by the coming between of which it eaſily is united with Salt and the other Principles; and as Spirit beſt agrees with Sulphur and Water, ſo Sulphur intimately cleaves to Earth and Salt.</p>
                     <p>As to Sulphur, beſides its affinity with Spirit, it hath a great relation with Salt it ſelf, to the volatiliſation of which it doth not a little help: wherefore in Bodies which abound with a volatile Salt, there is found plenty of Sulphur, as in Amber, Soot, Hornes and Bones, as alſo in the excrements of living Creatures; where Salt and Sulphur are in motion, and evaporate from the ſubject, a very ſtinking ſmell is ſent
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:107016:9"/>forth; for Sulphur being ſharpned with Salt, pricks more ſtrongly the ſenſory, and ſtrikes it with its ſharpneſs; in the mean time, Sulphur exhaling with Spirit, both pleaſes the ſenſe, and excites a very pleaſant Smell.</p>
                     <p>Sulphur is as it were diſtracted between Spirit and Salt, and adheres at once to both parties. In the Diſtillation of Amber, Turpentine, Harts-Horn, and the like, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain leſſer part of Sulphur, being united to Spirit, firſt aſcends, and cauſes a Yellow Oyl, or clear Liquor of a grateful ſmell: the other part of Sulphur, being joyned to the Salt, is driven forth in the ſecond place, and is Diſtilied with a moſt ſtinking ſmell, in the form of a red or black Oyl: In like manner, in the Circulation of the blood, a pure and delicate portion of Sulphur, being mixed with the Spirit, ſupplies both the Animal and Vital Spirit with matter; the other more thick part, being Boyled and Roſted with Salt, is layd up in the Choledock Veſſels (or belonging to Choler) as it were a certain excrement ſeparated from the blood. As Spirit does not eaſily Cohere with Salt, ſo Sulphur does not with Water: wherefore Fat and Oyly things, as alſo Gumms and Sulphureous Reſines, either ſwim upon the Water, or ſink down to its bottom. But Sulphureous things, Salt coming between, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with a Watery Liquor, as we ſee Oyls imbued with Sugar or Salt, to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in common Water, which otherwiſe would flow ſeparate.</p>
                     <p>Sulphur is not ſo tractable in Diſtillation, as Spirit, Water, or Salt: for the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of this, being very Viſcous, ſtick together among themſelves, and alſo to others, that they cannot eaſily be pulled from their embrace. Hence among Sulphureous things, there are ſome, which are not forced, but by a ſtrong and burning heat, into a ſtinking Oyl, and very empyreumatick, or ſmellin go Fire: but others, more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly cleaving together, are not to be looſened by Diſtillation, but are only broken into integral parts; and ſo aſcend under the form of a dry Breath, as common Sulphur, Benzoin, Camphor, and the like.</p>
                     <p>Salt, beſides its affinity with Sulphur, is alſo moſt ſtrictly united with Earth; wherefore Stones, and the more hard Minerals, conſiſt chiefly of Salt and Earth. The Acid Spirits of Minerals, (which are only Salts reſolved into Liquor by Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) if at laſt they be poured on the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> Cohere with a ſtrict embrace to it, that there will be need of a moſt ſtrong Fire, to drive them forth again. Alſo in Glaſs, the union of Salt and Earth is ſo ſtrictly made, that it will not ſuffer a Divorce by any means. Salt alſo is moſt eaſily diſſolved in Water; and it melts of its own accord, in a moiſt Air: and theſe are as eaſily ſeparated one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon of theſe Combinations, theſe Principles have got various Appellations, and not Congruous in their own Nature to themſelves. For Sulphur, for as much as it is Aſſociated with Spirit, is called pure and ſweet; when with Salt, impure and ſtinking, for as much as with Salt and Earth, it is called thick and Earthly; when the Spirit aſſumes to it ſelf Sulphureous Particles in a moderate quantity, it is ſeen to be ſweet; when ſaline, ſharp; when both, bitter. Salt has a diverſe diſpoſition, and is known by many names, by reaſon of its various mixture with the other Elements, and chiefly with Earth: for beſides the Titles of Fluid, Fixed, Volatile, for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is termed Marine, Aluminous, Nitrous, Vitriolick, Armoniack, or of ſome other kind. By ſome, theſe kind of Conjugations are eſteemed, but wrongfully, as ſo many divers Principles, when they are but more ſimple mixtures, by the coming together of the firſt Elements, and being looſened by Diſtillation they openly ſhew their Race, from whence they are. For all Salts whatſoever being driven into a Flux by the Fire, ſhew Liquors very near of Kin one to another, to wit, Acetous: by the like means Spirit and Sulphur are compelled to put off their Masks, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the Native Species common to each.</p>
                     <p>And ſo much for the Principles of Natural Things, and of their Affections and conjunctions. It is abundantly manifeſt, that theſe kind of Subſtances are in every Body, (beſides the Analyſes of Bodies Chymically inſtituted) alſo from the Mutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and effects of Things, which happen of their own Nature. When Muſt is Ripened into Wine, is not Spirit, a Sulphureous part, alſo Salt, and Earth Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous to our Taſt and Eyes, beſides the watery Liquor? Alſo the Juice of every Plant being exalted by Digeſtion, exhibits the ſame ſincere, and as it were diſtinct: what is greater, things ſubject to the Flame, when they ſeem to be burnt, and reduced al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to nothing, they go into theſe kind of Particles; beſides the Salt remaining in the Aſhes, the Smoke and Flame grow together into Soot, as it were a Meteor, in which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:107016:9"/>are comprehended together, Spirit, Sulphur, Salt, Water, and Earth, as it were in a certain compendium of the mixture. For the active Principles abound in Soot more than in any other inanimate Body.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe with ſome there hath ſpread a certain ſuſpicion, that thoſe our Princl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, chiefly the Saline and Sulphureous, are to be produced for the moſt part by Fire, and are no ways to be found in mixt things, unleſs after the coming between of that: I will witneſs to you in ſome inſtances, that the thing is plainly otherwiſe. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the firſt, It is commonly known, that the Aſhes of every Plant, being once E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixivated, or made into a Lye, if it be afterwards Calcined, will not yield any thing of Salt; beſides if Concretes being Diſtilled, Exhale or Breath forth a very ſharp or acid Liquor, their Calx is not ſaltiſh; and on the contrary when the Salt being Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilized or brought to a Flux, aſcends the Alembic, you ſhall ſeek for it in vain in the dead head. To prove the exiſtency of the Sulphureous Principle in Vegetables, take Guaiacum, or a piece of any other ponderous Wood, and being put into a Glaſs Retort, draw it forth by degrees; it ſhall exhibit, together with an Acid Liquor (which water is ſaltiſh) in great quantity, a blackiſh Oyl (which part of it is Sulphureous.) It appears from hence that this was in the Body before the Diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and in no wiſe produced by its Operation, becauſe if you proceed after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner, that the Sulphur may be taken out of the Concrete before Diſtillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Liquor that comes forth will be almoſt wholy deprived of its Oylineſs: Wherefore, if you pour Spirit of Wine to thoſe Chips of Wood, it will Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract in a great quantity, by this Menſtruum, a pure Reſine, which is the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous part if ſelf: then if you Diſtill (as before) in a Retort, the remaining Chips being waſhed in common Water and dryed, you will have a very little Oyl only. What is more to be admired, and confirms alſo more fully the truth of this kind of Origination, ſome Bodies, which being almoſt deſtitute of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Sulphur (becauſe chiefly Volatile) conſiſt chiefly of Salt, Earth and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are ſeparated into theſe Elements by Diſtillation: the ſame mixture in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and wholy known by the ſame accidents, is reſtored to them, being min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled together again; for example, if you Diſtil Vitriol in a Reverberating Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, you ſhall have a Phlegm almoſt inſipid, or a Watery part, then a Liquor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſour, or a Salt having gotten a Flux, and in the bottom, a Red Earth, and finely Purpled: this being rightly performed, if the two Diſtilled Liquors be poured to the dead head, you ſhall have the ſame Vitriol, as you had before, and again revived, in the ſame Colour, taſt, yea and almoſt in weight. In like manner you may procced, with the ſame ſucceſs, with Nitre, Sea-Salt, Salt of Tartar, and perhaps with Alum and other Minerals: So that thoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretes, which conſiſt of fixed, and ſtable Elements, may like a Mechanick En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine be pulled into pieces, and preſently without hurting the Machine, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored or made whole. But there is enough ſpoken concerning the Principles of Natural Bodies. Theſe being thus premiſed, we will proceed to the thing propoſed in the beginning, to wit, the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> What Fermentation is: Its Diviſion as to the Subjects, and firſt of Minerals.</head>
                     <p>FErmentation is an inteſtine motion of Particles, or the principles of every Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, either tending to the perfection of the ſame Body, or becauſe of its change into another. For the Elementary Particles being ſtirred up into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either of their own accord or Nature, or occaſionally, do wonderful more themſelves, and are moved; do lay hold of and obvolve one another: the fubtil and more active, unfold themſelves on every ſide, and endeavour to fly away; which notwithſtanding being intangled, by others more thick, are deteined in their flying
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:107016:10"/>away. Again, the more thick themſelves, are very much brought under, by the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Expanſion of the more Subtil, and are attenuated, until each of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought to their height and exaltations, they either frame the due perfection in the ſubject, or compleat the alterations and mutations deſigned by Nature.</p>
                     <p>Fermentation is an action or motion meerly Natural, and what doth perform it, are only Particles Naturally implanted in the Concrete; yet as to the ſubjects in which they are found, it is wont to be variouſly diſtinguiſhed. And either things of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſaid to ferment in a threefold Family, of Minerals, Vegetables and Animals; or the Works of Art, to wit, when Actives are applied to Paſſives by an outward A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. Though the Term and conſideration of Fermentation, are chiefly due to Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial things, and things made by Hand, yet it will not be from the puropſe, to ſpeak firſt ſomthing of Natural Things, that a Compariſon being made of either, the Truth of our Hypotheſis, and the certainty of the Principles may be confirmed. But this only lightly and by the way, in this place I ſhall paſs over, becauſe their more full handling belongs to Phyſiology, or the Doſcourſe of Natural or Phyſical Things.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, as to Minerals, altho in the Bowels of the Earth, the Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is leſs conſpicuous than in the Superſicies, yet it eaſily appears that the Elementary Particles, or the Fermentative Principles, are included in the depth of the Earth, as in a certain pregnant Womb: which there conſtitute Concretes, and things gathered together, by ſtrict Embraces, the Productions of Minerals; but being looſned, and moved in the Boſom of the Earth, or exhaled upwards, cauſe the appearances of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teors.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, The Generation of the more hard Minerals, induces rather Congelation than Fermentation; becauſe indeed theſe Principles, growing together in every Subject, are ſo fixed, and as it were bound together in Bonds, that they are not able any ways to move themſelves, or to depart one from another. This kind of Fixation chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the plenty and greater proportion of Salt and Earth, (ſomtimes with an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sulphur) than there is of Spirit or Water, To wit, Salt and Earth, being moſt ſmally broken, and reſolved even into a Vapour, lay hold of one another, and ſtiffen into a hard matter, and at laſt not to be looſned; almoſt after the ſame manner as making of Glaſs, and the burning of Bricks and Earthen Ware, are performed. For Glaſs conſiſts of Salt and Earth, which when being broken into moſt ſmall bits by a very intenſe Fire, they ſuffer a Flux, they mutually lay hold of one another, and ſo ſtrictly and intimately come together, that they arenever to be parted. Glaſs is more fragil, or eaſie to be broken, than Earthen Pots, or Minerals, becauſe it has a greater plenty of Salt, than of Earth, which is more plentiful in Earthen Ware, and in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals: To ſome of which, alſo happens a modicum of Sulphur, and for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they are more tenacious and ductil; as is to be obſerved in Metals, when in the mean time ſtones, and what contain little of Sulphur, are fragil, and apt by every ſtroke, to fly to pieces. In Vitrification there is need of a violent Fire, for the fuſion of the Salt and the Earth, (whoſe Particles, as is commonly ſaid, are the Peſtles of the Chymiſts) but within the Bowels of the Earth, there is not required ſuch a fuſion by Fire, for the Concretion of Minerals, becauſe Salt and Sulphur exiſt, being na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſolved into moſt ſimple Particles; which, when they lay hold on the Earth, eaſily ſtiffen into Metal, or into a ſtony hardneſs. There are ſome Fountains found out, which, for that they folw with a Primitive Salt, and reſolved into ſmall Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, what every Bodies are immerſed therein, they cauſe them preſently to become ſtony. We have read alſo, of Men changed into Stones, yea a whole City to have been ſtiffned into a ſtony ſubſtance, by the Air, or by ſome Vapour brought forth of the Earth: The Faith of which thing is left to the Authors.</p>
                     <p>Meteors are made out of the ſame Principles by which Minerals are made, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived almoſt in the ſame Womb: but looſned from Concretion wandring here and there, and diverſly fluctuating: or which being included in Subterraneous Vaults, and there moved, produce divers Springings up of Fountains, or ebullitions of hot Vapours; or exhaling from the Dens of the Earth, and being mixed with Airy little Bodies, they cauſe within the Region of the Atmo-Sphear, as it were a diverſe faſhio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Landskip, of Clouds, Winds, and the appearances of other things, in the Superficies of the Earth, or on high: in either there are highly active Principles, chiefly Salt and Sulphur. Spirits are either deficient in Meteors, even as in Minerals, or are found only in a very ſmall quantity or proportion: to wit, they are almoſt wholly excluded from theſe, by reaſon of the ſtrict frame of the Subject, which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:107016:10"/>doth not eaſily yield ſpace, and paſſage for their motion; alſo they abſtain from thoſe (<hi>viz.</hi> Meteors) by reaſon of the lax, and wholly looſe ſtructure of Matter, from whence they, who are mighty in ſwiftneſs, eaſily break forth, and deſire to fly away.</p>
                     <p>Within the Boſome of the Earth, the Saline Particles being looſned, even into a Vapour, and then kneaded with an Earthy Matter or the moiſtning of Waters, they cauſe Eruptions of Fountains, and Acidulous or Spaw Waters, which reſemble the diſpoſition of Vitriol, Alum, Nitre, ſomtimes of Iron or Copper. Alſo the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous little Bodies being looſned, and gathered together, inkindle an Heat, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Subterraneous Fires; by whoſe Breaths the Dens and Caverns being made Hot, like an Hot-Houſe, whilſt the Watery humors paſs through them, they from thence conceive their Heat, and ſupply the Springs of Hot Fountains for Bathes.</p>
                     <p>In like manner, in this viſible and Etherial world, Vapours both Sulphureous and Saline, and of a diverſe Kind and Nature, perpetually breath forth, and are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the whole Region of Air. From hence the diverſity of winds, the viciſſitudes of Cold and Heat, Rain, Snow, Hail, Dew, and Hoar Froſt, and what are of this Nature, have their Origine. Concerning the particular inſtances of theſe, the famous <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> may be conſulted, who in his <hi>Epicurean</hi> Philoſophy, moſt aptly deduces the Phaenomena, almoſt of all Meteors, and the reaſons of them, from the Exhalations of Sulphur, and Salts, either Nitrous, Vitriolick, Aluminous or Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niack.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of Fermentation for as much as is obſerved in Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</head>
                     <p>IN Vegetable, Fermentation is yet more plainly diſcerned: for whilſt they Bud forth, Grow, Flower, hear Fruit, Ripen, Decline and Dye, we may obſerve the divers motions of Particles or Principles, their various Habits and Tempers. I intend not here to deſcribe the ſeveral ways and proceedings of theſe. It will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, for the undolding the Doctrine of Fermentation, to take notice of ſome chief inſtances, concerning this Subject.</p>
                     <p>If is manifeſt, by dayly Experience, that all Plants whatſoever, expoſed to a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrical or Chymical Operation, may with little labour, be reſolved into the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid five-fold Elements; But in ſome there is found a greater plenty of Salt, in others of Sulphur; in ſome Spirits abound: Water, and Earth, are in moſt proportionated, according to the Bulk and magnitude of the thing. Plants in which Salt abounds, with a mean of Sulphur, and a little quantity of Spirits, are for the moſt part of long Age, ſomwhat big, or flouriſh all the Winter, or tho their Leaves fall, they keep a Nutricious Juice under the Bark. Of which ſort are the Oak, Aſh, Elm, Box-Tree, and all ponderous Woods and Shrubs.</p>
                     <p>In ſome Sulphur abounds, wiht a little Salt and Spirit, as are the Pine, the Firr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tree, Cyprus Tree, Juniper, Ivy, Olive, Cedar, and Myrtle Trees, and all reſinous Plants; which, for the moſt part have a ſweet ſmell, and are perpetually Green, by reaſon the juice, wherewith they are nouriſhed, is viſcous, and not eaſily to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated. In others, beſides plenty of Salt, and Sulphur, Spirits alſo are found, in a greater proportion, as are Fruit-bearing Trees, and eſpecially the Vine, from whoſe Fruit the Juice being wrung out, and purified by Fermentation, grows very big with Spirit. Of this rank are Plants for the moſt part Medicinal, alſo ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Curious, and Odoriferous Flowers, But in ſome Water and Earth luxuriat in too great a quantity above the other Elements, as in cold Plants, and ſuch as grow in too rank a Soil.</p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:107016:11"/>
                     <p>The Germination of Plants happens after this manner, either it is made out of the Seed, Root, Trunk, or of its own Nature, from the naked matrix of the Earth. Firſt, the Spirit being ſhut up within, by the Ambient Heat and Moiſture looſening the frame of the mixture, being looſned, it preſently endeavours to fly away: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held back in its flight, by the more thick Particles of the reſt, ſtretches forth more largely its Den, and together with the other Principles, with which it is bound, thruſts forth on every ſide, into length and breadth: even as a little bundle of Silk, being contracted into wrincles and folds, is opened here and there: In the mean time, the little Spaces left by the enlargement of the Spirit, and as it were made hollow, are filled up by the next Matter, driven even into the Vacuities. And after this manner the Architect Spirit, with his Miniſters, Salt and Sulphur, ſtill ſtretching forth it ſelf, like a Snail, frames for it ſelf an Houfe, whoſe Inhabitant it is, and by dilating it ſelf, ſtretches forth that, until at laſt it hath wrought the Plant into the due Bulk and Figure deſigned by Nature.</p>
                     <p>You may take notice, that the times of the year, for the Budding, Flowring, Ripening, and decaying of Vegetables, are of great Efficacy and Virtue: All the Winter, the Womb of the Earth, as it were ſhut up, is almoſt barren: for the Spirituous Particles, which are wont to actuate the reſt, and as it were to lead the dance of Natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are either chaſed away by the Winters Cold, or being Congealed in their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, are fixed: Wherefore at this time Germination and Vegetation are very rare, unleſs that ſome irregular Plants, which are compoſed of plenty of Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, dare to break forth. But in the Spring, when the bowels of the Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be a little warm, by the Vicinity of the Sun, preſently they are impregnated with a wonderful Fecundity, and produce the effects of their Seminality. Not only the Superficies of the Earth, but alſo the Water and Air, every where, grow big with Spirituous Particles; which as it were raiſe up from the Dead, the little Bodies of Salt, and Sulphur, and bring them into Motion: Therefore, beſides that the Plants Bud, the Juice and Blood of living Creatures is quicker and more apt to abound. At this time the Birds and Fiſhes build their Neſts, and bring forth Eggs: alſo we may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in our ſelves the Blood to flow high in the Veſſels, and uſually to Ferment too much. For all things are then full of this Aetherial Subſtance, and the whole Bulk of Nature, as it were inſpired by a lively Fermentation, is abundantly fruitful of Motions and Generations. Yea, theſe our Principles, at firſt ſeparated and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed one from another, led as it were by an Appetite of Copulation, enter into mutual Marriages, and being Married together, almoſt with infinit Embraces, cauſe a moſt ample Seeding, and Germination of the Herby State.</p>
                     <p>At the beginning of the Summer, (and perhaps in ſome ſooner in ſome later) when ſufficient time hath been granted for the Stature and Magnitude of every Plant, and that it is now come to the highth of increaſe; it behoves Nature to perfect her Work, and to cook and ripen the Subſtance, as yet rude and undigeſted: Wherefore the active Principles leiſurely extricate themſelves from the more thick, and creep forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the top, there being placed with a mutual increaſe, they are formed into Flowers and Bloſſoms, from which at length (for that they are of a ſoft and light texture) Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Sulphur eaſily evaporate, and the frame of the mixture quickly decays. But Nature careful of the perpetuating every thing, when it cannot keep for ever the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduum, is ſo provident, that the Species may not wholly periſh: Wherefore ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes new and more firm and laſting Combinations of Spirit, Salt and Sulphur. For ſhe ſelects from the whole Subſtance of the Plant, the more noble and highly active Particles, and theſe being gathered together, with a little Earth and Water, ſhe forms in the Seed, as it were the quinteſſences of every Plant; in the mean time the Trunk, Leaves, Stalks, and the other Members of the Plant; being almoſt quite deprived of the active Principles, are much depauperated, and are of leſs Efficacy and Virtue.</p>
                     <p>About Autumn, after the Seeds are framed, (as it were pledges left in memory of the Plant) the Particles of Spirits, Salt and Sulphur, which remain, being now placed in their Strength or Exaltation, endeavour a Diſſolution, and Departing one from another. And firſt of all, the Spirits evaporate by degrees with the Watery humour, through the Doors fet open by the Summer Sun, with which the more pure parts of the Sulphur, make alſo their Journey: in the mean time the Salt being fixed with the Earth, and more thick Sulphur, is left behind: Wherefore in moſt the Leaves fall at this time, and in thoſe of a tender and light Conſtitution, the Principles are
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:107016:11"/>wholly diſſipated, and the Trunk and Stalk, together with the Root, wholly die. In ſome, after the falling of the Seed, with the Leaves, the Stalks wither; in the mean time the Principles, which may renew the Plant in the next Spring, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Root.</p>
                     <p>Alſo Winter coming on, the face of things is wholly changed; and the Elements, which in the Spring did affect to be Joyned and to Marry one with another, ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than Divorces. The Spirits fly away from very many things, and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the Air; in the mean time the Particles of Salt and Sulphur lie as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nummed and aſleep. Not only the Bodies of Vegetables, but of very many Animals, are left as it were dead all the Winter, till they are raiſed again to life by the Spirit, returning with the Vernal Sun, and as it were animated anew. But this little Branch being made concerning the Vegetation of Plants, it is now fit that we proceed on our Journey to Fermentation, by the Rule of our before eſtabliſhed Method, to what is to be obſerved, concerning the parts, and humours of Living Creatures.</p>

                     <p>IT is ſo certain that the Bodies of Animals, conſiſt of the aforeſaid Principles, that it wants no proof. For they ſo plentifully ſwell up, with Spirit, Salt and Sulphur, that their Particles are obvious to the ſenſe: Wherefore th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> are moved with a more ſwift motion, and more excellent ſenſes of Life, and Functions of Heat, in the Sujects, in which they are implanted, are inlarged. It would be too much labour, and tedious, here to deſcribe, the ſeveral manners and proceſſes of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. The firſt beginnings of Life proceed from the Spirit Fermenting in the Heart, as it were in a certain little punct. The motion of this, is not as in Vegetables, ſlow and inſenſible, and only to be known by their increaſing; but preſently becoming rapid, is conſpicuous to the Eyes: becauſe the Spirit leaping from the Punct, as from a Priſon, being ſtirred, and having obtained the Vehicle of Blood, ſwiftly runs forth; and leaping forth, it cannot wholy fly away, it makes hollow ſpaces for it ſelf in the thick ſubſtance, in which it is included, for its excurſion, being compelled ſome other way backward. Laſtly being returned to the Heart, it Ferments the more, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſtretches forth further the ſpaces of its Excurſion, and ſo eaſily makes an hollow way for its return back; and after this manner, for the carrying about the Blood, Arteries and Veins, as Channels and Rivulets are framed through all the parts of the Body: and on ſuch a Viciſſitude of Motion, or Reciprocation, depends the life of living Creatures, which, that Nature might preſerve a long while, ſhe placed the Ferment in the Heart, by whoſe inſtinct, or endeavour, the Blood grows impetuouſly Hot, and as it were inkindled into a Flame by its Deflagration, diffuſes the <hi>effluvia</hi> of its Heat round about on every ſide: for by the Fermentation, or Accenſion which the Blood ſuffers in the Boſome of the Heart, very many Particles of Spirit, Salt and Sulphur, endeavour to break forth from its looſened frame: by which being much rarified, and like Water boyling over a Fite, the moved and boyling Blood is carried through the Veſſels, not without great Tumult and Turgeſcency. We would ſpeak more in this place, both of the Natural Fermentation of the Blood, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, but that we reſerve this Conſideration for a peculiar Tract, where we Treat of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Beſides this Ferment conſtituted in the Chimny of the Heart, upon which the motion and heat of the Blood very much depends, there are others laid up every where in the Bowels, of a diverſe diſpoſition, by the help of which, both the Chyle (which is the Rudiment or Beginning of the Blood) and the Animal Spirits, its Quinteſſence, are truly framed. There are others alſo which ſerve for the perfecting the Blood, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting it into other Liquors, and freeing it from Excrementitious Matter: It will
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:107016:12"/>be too far from our propoſed method, to wander, to inſiſt upon each of theſe, and to reap anothers Harveſt: Wherefore I will only add in this place, ſome ſelect inſtances, which may illuſtrate the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>It is commonly received, that the Concoction of the Chyle, in the Ventricle, is made by the means of a certain Acid Ferment: That ſuch a thing is the Acid belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a full Stomach, and the want of it in the loſs of Stomach, in Feaveriſh and Dyſenterical people do teſtifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and its reſtitution a ſign of Health: to which may be added this Obſervationn; Chalybeat Medicines being taken at the Mouth, a little after excite a Sulfureous ſavour in the Throat, as if hard roſted Eggs had been eaten: which ſeems wholly to be made by the Acid Ferment of the Ventricle, gnawing the Iron, even as Spirit of Vitriol, being ſprinkled upon the fileings of Steel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites ſuch a ſtinking and Sulphureous Odor. Some ſay this Ferment is breathed into the Stomach from the Spleen, but by what means that may be done doth not yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by Anatomical Obſervation. It ſeems not improbable that this Ferment is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the Ventricle, that it is only made by ſome remains of the perfected Chyle, which fixed in the folds of the Ventricle. and there growing ſowr, puts on the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Ferment; even as a portion of Dough being fermented or levened, and and kept to a ſowrneſs, becomes a convenient Ferment or Leven, for the making of Bread. In like manner this kind of Acid humour being prepared from the Aliments, and long carried in the Ventricle, promotes the Concoction, and ſubaction or ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Food. For Acid things, which are full of Salt, carried out to a Flux, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently conduce both to the Fermenting and Diſſolving of Bodies: Wherefore by the action of this, Salt and Sulphur, with which eatable things very much abound, are broken in the Ventricle, and are reduced into very ſmall parts. The Chyle being after this manner Fermented, acquires a Milky colour, by reaſon that the Sulphureous Particles are diſſolved together with the Saline, and mixed with the Acid Ferment. For if you pour an Acetous humour to any Liquor impregnated with Sulphur and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt, it preſently grows white like Milk; as may be diſcerned in the preparing the Milk of Sulphur, or the Reſinous extracts of Vegetables. Yea, the Spirits of Harts Horn, or Soot, being very full of Volatile Salt, if they be poured to any Acid Liquor, or ſimple Water, acquire a Milky colour.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Ferment hid in the folds of the Ventricle, it is obſerved that it is after various manners, and changes the Aliments by a diverſe means: for tho in a ſound Conſtitution it is indifferently Acid, and chiefly owes its force and energie to the Salt being brought to a Flux; yet it often declines from this laudable condition, and conteins in it ſelf either too much of ſowrneſs, or leſs than it ought to have: In the former Caſe, where the Salt hath got too ſowr a Dominion, all things taken in, (the Saline Particles being carried forth to a Flux, and the reſt unduly brought under) preſently grow ſour: as moſt often happens in Hypochondriack Diſtempers: on the other ſide, where the Volatile Principles obtain the firſt place, (Fermentation being too haſtily made) the Sulphureous parts of the Chyle are ſuddenly, and as it were force<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably exalted, and the unconcocted of the Saline, paſs into Choler: which ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily happens to thoſe abounding with bitter Choler. They therefore who have the Ventricle affected after this latter manner, Sweet and Fat meats being eaten, they are troubled with a bitter and bilious Taſte: Again, they who ſuffer the contrary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, altho they eat the moſt ſimple Food, ſend forth plentifully Acid and Stinking belchings: and indeed this ſeems to come to paſs even after the ſame manner, as when a little too much Yeſt is put to the Batch of Dough, it becomes bitter; or when too great a Portion of ſour Ferment, or Leven is put to the ſame Dough, the Bread from thence contracts a mighty ſowrneſs.</p>
                     <p>As the Blood in the Heart, and appending Veſſels, the Chyle in the Ventricle, ſo the Animal Spirit is wrought in the Brain, whoſe Original and Motions are very much in the dark. Neither doth it plainly appear, as to the Animal Spirit, by what work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man it is prepared, nor by what Channels it is carried, at a diſtance, quicker than the twinkling of an Eye. But it ſeems to me that the Brain with Scull over it, and the appending Nerves, repreſent the little Head or Glaſſie Alembic, with a Spunge laid upon it, as we uſe to do for the highly rectifying of the Spirit of Wine: for truly the Blood when Rarified by Heat, is carried from the Chimny of the Heart, to the Head, even as the Spirit of Wine boyling in the Cucurbit, and being reſolved into Vapour, is elevated into the Alembick; where the Spunge covering all the opening of the Hole, only tranſmits or ſuffers to paſs through the more penetrating and very ſubtil
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:107016:12"/>Spirits, and carries them to the ſnout of the Alembick: in the mean time, the more thick Particles, are ſtayed, and hindred from paſſing. Not unlike this manner, the blood being delated into the Head, its ſpirituous, volatil, and ſubtil Particles, being reſtrained within by the Skull, and its <hi>menyuges,</hi> as by an Alembick, are drunk up by the ſpungy ſubſtance of the Brain, and there being made more noble or excellent, are derived into the Nerves, as ſo many ſnouts hanging to it. In the mean time the more craſs or thick Particles of the blood, being hindred from entring, are carried back by Circulation: But the highly agil and ſubtil Spirits enter the ſmalleſt and ſcarcely at all open pores of the Brain and Nerves, and run through them with a wonderful ſwiftneſs: For there is need only of ſuch Receptacles and Channels, for the Animal Spirit, in which there are none, or at leaſt very ſmall cavities or holes; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the blood or excrementitious humours, their Followers and Companions would not be excluded. Alſo, beſides, if theſe Spirits ſhould run about through too open and looſe ſpaces, being eaſily diſſipated, they would fly away: wherefore, when there is need of a Pipe for the tranſmitting of blood, or ſerous water, the Spirit of Wine runs rapidly through the ſecret paſſages of the Inſtrument or Leather. Neither doth the more ſtrict frame of the Brain and Nerves ſerve only for the ſtraining of the ſubtil from the thick, and the pure from the impure; but alſo that ſpirituous and moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Liquor, being as it were diſtilled from the blood, gets yet a farther perfection in the Brain; for there being inſpired by a certain Ferment, whereby it is yet more volati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſed, it is made more fit for the performing the offices of motion and ſenſe. Becauſe the ſubſtance of the Brain is exceeding full of a Volatile Salt, which is of great Virtue for the ſharpning and ſubtiliſing the Spirits; therefore the Spirits of Harts Horn, or of Soot, are far more penetrating than Spirits of Wine.</p>
                     <p>The Seminal Veſſels and Genital Parts, do ſo ſwell up with Fermentative Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, that there is nothing more: here Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, being together compacted, and highly exalted, ſeem in the Seed to be reduced as it were into a moſt noble Elixir. Theſe kind of active Principles do not only Ferment in the Womb, for the forming of the Child or Young ones, but alſo as it were with a living Ferment, they inſpire through all the Body, the whole Maſs of blood, that it may be more Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and more ſharply Hot: wherefore in women who have the Ferment of the Womb in good order, their Face is furniſhed with a curious and flouriſhing colour, their heat is more lively and copious; moreover, the Maſs of Blood growing too rank, there is need of emptying it every Month by the Flux of their Courſes; but when this Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation from the Womb is wanting, both Virgins and Women become Pale, and as it were without blood, ſhort winded, and unfit for any motion. Alſo in men, from the Seminal Ferment, happen abundance of heat, great ſtrength, a ſounding Voice, and a manly eruption of Beard and Hair; by reaſon of the defect of this, men grow womaniſh, to wit, a ſmall Voice, weak Heat, and want of Beard are cauſed.</p>
                     <p>Since we Treat of Ferments, which are found in the Animal Body, we may here opportunely inquire, what is the uſe of the Spleen: concerning which all good things are ſaid by ſome; that it is as it were another Liver, and ſerves for the making of blood, for the <hi>Viſcera</hi> of the lower Belly: It is by others reputed to be of a moſt vile uſe; that it is only the Sink or Jakes, into which the Feculencies of the blood are caſt. By reaſon of its ſtructure, we make this ſort of conjecture; becauſe the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, do carry the blood to this, and the Veins bring it away, neither any other thing is carried in, or conveyed out, and for that its ſubſtance is filled with black, and ſtagnating blood, it ſeems that it is as it were a ſtore-houſe for the receiving of the earthy and muddy part of the blood: which afterwards, being exalted into the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a Ferment, is carried back to the blood for the heating of it: Wherefore, while the blood being carried by the Arteries enters the Spleen, ſomthing is drawn from it, to wit, the muddy and terreſtrial Particles, which are as it were the dregs, and <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> of the blood; that by this means the whole Maſs of the Blood, might be freed from the Melancholick or Atrabilous Juice; which is ſeparated in the Spleen, even as the yellow Bile or Choller, is in the Liver: wherefore, for the moſt part the Spleen is of a black or blewiſh colour, by reaſon of the Feculencies or dregs there lay'd up. But as this Juice depoſited in the Milt or Spleen, is not altogether unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, but by reaſon of the plenty of fixed Salt, is of a very Fermenting Nature; it is not preſently, as the Choler, caſt into the ſink, but is farther Cooked in the Spleen, and being exalted goes into a Ferment; which being laſtly committed to the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:107016:13"/>blood promotes its motion and Volatiliſation: Wherefore, as ſomthing is drawn from the blood, entring the Spleen by the Arteries, to wit, the Crude Juice of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy; ſo ſomthing is continually added to the ſame, flowing back through the Veins, to wit, the ſame Juice concocted and exalted into the Nature of a Ferment: Even as Chymiſts, in Diſtilling, that the Liquor may be made better, ſeparate the Subtile and Spirituous parts, from the <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> and then pour them on it again; and this work they ſo often repeat, till the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi> or dead Head, is by frequent Diſtillation Volatized, and the Liquor rightly exalted, even in all its Particles. That this is the uſe of the Spleen, it is a ſign, for that this inward being ill affected, the blood either ferments too much, as in the Scorbutick and Hypochondriack Diſtempers; or if the Spleen be obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or beſet with a Scirrhous Tumor, the blood is deſtitute of fit Fermentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cauſes the Dropſie, Cachexie or evil diſpoſition of the Body, or the Tym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
                     <p>As we aſſert, the Earth and muddy part of the blood, which conſiſts chiefly of Earth and fixed Salt, being ſeparated in the Spleen, to paſs there into a Ferment; ſo it ſeems not improbable, that alſo the Aduſt, or as it were the fiery part of the blood, to wit, the Yellow Bile, which conſiſts chiefly of Salt and Sulphur, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the Liver, and from thence tranſmitted to the inteſtines, ſerves for ſome uſe of Fermentation. For this being mixed with the Chyme or Juice, fallen from the Ventricle to the inteſtines, makes it there to grow hot and to ſwell up; whereby both the Elementary Particles are more overcome, and by reaſon of the Rarification or ſwelling up, the purer part is wrung forth into the Milky Veſſels, for the Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice.</p>
                     <p>We are not only born and nouriſhed by the means of Ferments: but we alſo die: Every Diſeaſe acts its Tragedies by the ſtrength of ſome Ferment. For either the Sulphureous and Spirituous part of the blood, being too much carried forth, boils up immoderately in the Veſſels, like Wine growing hot, and from thence Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of a divers kind and nature are inkindled: or ſomtimes the Saline part of the blood, being too much carried froth, ſuffers a Flux; and from thence it being made acid, auſtere, and ſomtimes ſharp, is apt for various Coagulations: from which the Scurvy, Dropſie, Stone, Leproſie, and very many Chronical Diſeaſes ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Yea we alſo endeavor the Cure of Diſeaſes by the help of Fermentation: For to the preſerving or recovering the Health of man, the buſineſs of a Phyſician and a Vint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, is almoſt the ſame: the blood and humors even as Wine, ought to be kept in an equal temper and motion of Fermentation: wherefore when the blood grows too hot, even as Wine, it is uſual to empty ſome out of the Veſſels, and to allay its Fervor with temperat things. If any extraneous or heterogeneous thing, is mixed with it, unleſs growing hot of its own accord, it drives it forth of doors; Purging, Vomiting, and Sweating Medicines, by ſhaking and fuſing the blood and humors, promote its ſecluſion: when that the blood is depauperated, and grows leſs hot than it ſhould do, Cardiacks, Digeſtives, and eſpecially Chalybeats or ſteeled Medicines reſtore its vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Fermenttation: no otherwiſe than Wines growing ſowr or degenerating into a deadneſs or want of ſtrength, are mixed with more rich Lees, whereby they may Purge or grow turgid anew. I could eaſily unfold the Curatory intentions, as alſo the effects and operations of every Medicine, according to the Doctrine of Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but I deſign aparticular meditation for this thing: for the perfecing of which ſerious work, God willing, I have determined to add to the buſineſs of Medicine, as I hope, ſomthing not unprofitable.</p>
                     <p>Having thus far wandered in the ſpacious field of Nature, we have beheld all things full of Fermentation; not only in the diſtinct Provinces of Minerals, Vegetables and Animals, do we diſcern the motions and effects of this, but alſo the whole Sublunary world, ſeems as if one and the ſame ſubſtance were planted, and very pregnant through the whole with Fementative Particles; which in every Region and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of it, as little Emmits in a Mole-hill, are buſied in perpetual motion and agitation; they fly about here and there; ſomtimes upwards, ſomtimes downward they are hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, they variouſly meet one another, aſſociate themſelves, and again depart aſunder; with a continual Viciſſitude they enter into divers Marriages, and ſuffer Divorces, on which the beginnings, the death, and tranſmutations of thins, depend. Theſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies do not only very much abound in the boſome of the Earth, or in the midſt of the waters, but they are eſpecially diffuſed through the whole Atmoſphear of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:107016:13"/>Air in thick heaps. It is ſufficient that I have noted in this place, ſome examples in a word: I have not determined a more full ſpeculation of them here. It is time that we proceed from Phyſical things, to the works of Art.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of Fermentation, as it is performed in Artificial things.</head>
                     <p>IN the works of Art, ſo various and manifold proviſion of Fermentation is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that it is altogether impoſſible to enumerate their ſeveral Species; or to reduce the divers inſtances of this to certain Claſſes or Heads of diſtribution. Making uſe of the thrid of the following method, we will ſubjoyn ſome exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, (which have happened to our obſervation) by whoſe rule, many others may be laid open.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Fermentation, which is made in the Subjects, made by hand, or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man induſtry, theſe three things are chiefly to be conſidered.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, of what Nature and Compoſition Bodies are, that are moſt fit for Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and which are leſs convenient for it.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, What things are requiſite about Fermentation, to wit, what are wont to promote, or alſo to hinder its motion in every Subject.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, How manifold the motion of Fermentation is, and the end of it; alſo what are the effects and alterations which follow it.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt, That all Bodies, (when tending to perfection) may truely Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are required,</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, That there be ſome parts looſe and disjoyned; otherwiſe the Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative Particles will not be ſtretched forth, or move from place to place: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the more hard compacted things, or in viſcous things, or too much boyled, or evaporated too a ſpiſſitude or dryneſs, Fermentation does not ſucceed. What are Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid, as Wine, Beer, the Juices of Fruits and Herbs, eaſily and quickly ſwell up; next to theſe what are ſoft, tho they are of a thicker Conſiſtency, as Bread, and moſt Eatable things, and Medicinal Compoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, It is required that there be an Heterogeneity of parts, or a confuſion of all the Principles together; to wit, that ſome Particles do oppoſe otheſs, and ſtir them into motion. For the more ſimple Bodies, in which one, or at moſt two Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentsonly are ſtrong, with a very ſmall proportion of the reſt, are unapt to Ferment: becauſe like Particles, or Symbolical Elements, lie benumed and quiet. But between the unlike, thereariſes preſently a ſtrife for domination, and ſome provoke others into motion.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, There is a third condition, that there be neither too much Crudity, nor Maturity of parts, in the body Fermenting. In the Former, the active and ſubtil particles, are not eaſily extricated from the more thick, nor are brought into motion: as it appears in Juices, which are preſſed forth from unripe Fruit; alſo in Beer which is made of Barly or Mault, not come forth or germinated. In the latter the Particles being made too volatile, are not contained in the bond of the mixture, but preſently evaporate, and diſpoſe their Subjects to Putrefaction. Wherefore, Juice expreſſed from Summer Fruits, or others too ripe, will not eaſily paſs into Wine, but it will quickly corrupt. And for this reaſon, extravaſated blood, milk, and urine, do not Ferment, but quickly putrifie.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſecond thing propoſed, there are many ways by which Fermentation is either promoted or hindred. The firſt and chiefeſt, is the adding of a certain Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the body Fermenting; the Particles of which, when being firſt placed in vigor and motion, may raiſe up the others, idle and ſluggiſh, in the to-be-fermented Maſs, and may drive them into motion. But there is a two-fold Ferment; either abſolute, which is the ſame kind of Body, in which the active Particles, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:107016:14"/>placed in their vigor, are notably in motion, and ſo whilſt they are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Subject in Fermenting, ſnatch with them into motion other Particles there of the every kind before ſluggiſh: by this means Barm or Yeſt, beaten Eggs, and ſuch like, ſtir up a Fermentation almoſt in every thing. Or the Ferment is reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, to wit, which conſiſts of Particles, very much of one kind, which meeting other of another kind, in the Maſs to be Fermented, grow hot with them, and ſo produce in the mixtnre a turgency or riſing up of all the parts together. After this manner Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, grow very hot, with other Salines, either fixed or alchaliſater; as appears when acetous Liquors are poured on Corrals, Harts Horn, ſhells of Fiſhes; alſo when the Spirit of Vitriol, and the Salt of Tartar, are put together, a great ebullition is excited.</p>
                     <p>There are ſome accidents and external circumſtances, which variouſly conduce, either to the provoking or hindring the motion of Fermentatio; of which ſort, are chiefly the condition of the Ambient Air, the placing or laying up of te body Ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the means of conſerving it.</p>
                     <p>The Southern Air (in which hot and humid Particles every where abound, which alſo entring eaſily any Bodies, obtain the force and place of a Ferment) impreſſes a notable motion of Fermentation in very many things: Wherefore in drinkable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, it doth not only raiſe up at firſt, the force of efferveſcency or growing hot, but alſo for a long while afterinduces new ſwellings up in them being Fermented. On the contrary, the Cold and Northern Air, binds up, and very much faſtens Bodies; and in very many things hinders them fuſions, and flowings of the Elements, and oftentimes, either hinders Fermentation from being ſtirred up, or reſtrains it being begun. Alſo the hot Summer Air, becauſe it too much moves the active Principles, drives away the Spirits and ſubtile parts, exalts the Sline, and Sulphureous into a Flux, and ſo perverts their equal motion; and either the Sulphur or Salt being too much carried forth, it eaſily brings to Bodies a rancidneſs or putrefaction, or a mouldineſs; which nothing favours the buſineſs of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>It is a vulgar opinion, that ſome ſelect times of the year, to wit, thoſe in which the Vegetables of every Kind flower, cauſe anew the motion of Fermentation in the Juices, and other things prepared of them, after they had Fermented a long time before; ſo that Beer, when the Barly, and Wines in the time that the Vine, flowers, conceive riſings up, or new Fermentations: they ſay alſo, that Bread and Flour, when the Wheat is in Flower, is want to become ſooner muſty and moldy: alſo that ſpots or ſtains of the Juices of Fruits, as the Mulberry, Blackberry, Rasberry, and ſuch like, being in Cloaths, are wont to be gotten forth again, at that time when thoſe Fruits are Ripe. Concerning theſe things, I ingenuouſly confeſs, that I have not made tryal of them, by my own proper obſervation; ſo as to dare to affirm it for truth in every part: I will therefore lightly paſs them over, for it would both grieve and ſhame me (leſt I ſhould relate falſe things) to Philoſophize concerning doubtful things.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the laying up of the Fermenting Body, theſe things are chiefly to be obſerved. When things firſt being to Ferment, that they are not to be ſhut up in too cloſe Veſſels, neither while the Liquors are hot, are they to be put into Bottles or Casks. For the Particles, at firſt boyling up, and as it were rarified, deſire a very large ſpace: wherefore the Fermentation of Wine or Beer, is begun in open large Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels: but when they grow leſs hot, thoſe kind of Liquors, leſt the Particles being ſet and moved into motion, too much, ſhould fly away from the Subject, they are kept beſt, either in a cold Cellar, or cloſe Veſſels. In the preparation of Vinegar, we bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the contrary, to wit, it is wont to be placed in a hot place near the Chimney or Oven, or expoſed to the Suns beams: to the end that the vinous Spirit being depreſſed, the Saline part might be exalted into a Flux, and ſo might give a ſharpneſs to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. There is another obſervation, that Liquors do Ferment better in wooden Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, than in Glaſs, or Stone: For by long infuſion, ſome Saline little Bodies are got froth of the Wood, eſpecially the Oaken, which promote Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>As to the third thing propoſed, concernign this thing; although to ſpeak properly, the motion of Fermentation, is only a carrying forth of the Principles confuſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, from a ſtate of Crudity towards maturity; and the end of it, is a tendency to the perfection of every thing: yet uſe or cuſtom hath obtained, that this word is attributed to very many other motions of Natural things, and includes other ends, and effects, far different. Therefore when the Fermentative Particles in any Body,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:107016:14"/>are greatly in motion, the alterations which follow thereupon, may be in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect referred to theſe three Claſſes.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, it either reſpects the exaltation, and perfection of the parts of the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or the reſolution, and corruption of them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Or the diſſolution of the parts of another Body is intended; or the praecipitation of thoſe looſened.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, By the motion and action of theſe kind of Principles, a coagulation, and alſo a congelation, now of the ſame Parts, now of different Bodies, are induced. It remains, that we briefly run through every one of thſe Species of Natural Motions, and ways or manners of Fermentation.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of Fermentation, as it is ſeen in the exaltation of Bodies, and tendency to Perfection.</head>
                     <p>THE Exaltaion of the parts, is perceived beſt in Works, or in all things appointed for human uſe, foraſmuch as they get a greater perfection and vigor, by Fermentation; as, chiefly Aliments and Medicines do: in many of theſe, we endeavour to carry forth the Spirituous Particles above the reſt; and ſo to procure in the mixture, a grateful ſweet taſt, and other agreeable qualities; as we may obſerve in Bread, Beer, Wine, Cider, and many others: But in ſome, we ſtrive to exalt the Saline part, the Spirit being ſomawhat depreſſed; as in Vinegar, Meath, Broths, alſo in Sauce, Pickle, or in Preſerved things, which are made of Salt and ſharp Liquors. We rarely on pourpoſe carry forth the Sulphureous part above the reſt, for from thence a ſtinking ſmell, and ingrateful rammiſhneſs, are wont to happen to eatable thinds. Among foods ſet apart for mans uſe, Bread, Beer, Wine, and Cider, have the firſt place; which own moſtly, whatever they have of virtue, or ſtrength, to Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the making of Bread, theſe things are chiefly to be obſerved: the Meal of Wheat, or Barly, or of any other Grain, being kneaded with common-water, is reduced to a maſs, to be afterwards baked in an Oven. If there be nothing elſe added to this, it becomes forthwith heavy, and ponderous like Clay, clammy, and of an ingrateful taſt, and of difficult digeſtion: but if in the kneading it, there be added a Ferment, the Maſs preſently grows hot, the bulk ſwells, and afterward being baked, it is made light, ſpongy, of good digeſtion and grateful to the taſt. If you deſire to know the reaſon of the difference, it is this. The meat of the Grain is imbued with a moderate proportion of Spirits, alſo of Salt, and Sulphur; but the Particles of theſe, are overwhelmed in the Maſs, with a viſcous humidity, being kneaded with water; ſo that they move not themſelves mutually, nor are in motion: wherefore in the baking, ſome ſuperfluoous humidity evaporates; what remains is cleaving, viſcous, and becomes preſſed cloſe like Clay, and ponderous. But when a Ferment is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with the Mealy Maſs, the active Particles of the Ferment being firſt-ſtir'd up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to motion, take hold of their Companions in the Mealy Maſs, and carry them with them into motin. By this means, whilſt ſome move others, they ſhortly are all ſtirred up into Fermentation; tumultuating here and there, they compaſs and run through the whole Paſt or DCough, they ſubtitiſe and attenuated the clammy and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene parts, and they lift up the maſs, with the motion, and make it hollow, with little holes; which yet in the mean time, leſt it become too ſpungy, and whereby the parts made hollow, and attenuated might more exactly be mixed, it is wrought with long kneading, then afterwards, before the Fermentation ceaſes, and before the hollowed parts ſink cloſe down, it is baked in the Oven. In the baking, the ſuperfluous moiſture evaporates, and moreover, very many Particles of Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, fly away; wherefore, the maſs becomes lighter, and leſs ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the mean time, thoſe which remain in the Bread, being much exalted,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:107016:15"/>and brought to maturity, cauſe in it a laudable conſiſtency, with a grateful ſmell, and taſt.</p>
                     <p>The Ferment commonly uſed, is a portion of the Mealy Maſs, and unbaked, which is kept, being imbued with Salt, to a ſowtneſs (it is called in French <hi>Levain,</hi> becauſe it lifts up the Maſs) or the flowring of Beer, or Ale, called Yeſt or Barm; or for want of theſe the lees or dregs of Beer, or beaten Eggs, are made uſe of. In the mealy Ferment, the Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, do chiefly predominate; as alſo in the faeces of Beer: wherefore the Bread Fermented by theſe, is made harſh and ſomwhat ſowr: In the mean time, Yeſt being very big with Spirit, Ferments the Bread more potently, and brings to the Maſs lightneſs, and a very grateful ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Beaten Eggs abound with Spirit and a Volatile Salt, and do yet more cauſe the Bread to Ferment, and render it more Spongy: without doubt there may be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kinds of Ferments uſed; for whatever are big and turgid with Spirit, or abound with Salt carried out to a Flux, ſeem to be fit enough for this uſe.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the mealy Maſs is kneaded with Sulphureous matter, as Butter, Sewet, Fat, or ſuch like, which being baked in an Oven, while it is hot, it is ſeen to be light and ſpongy, (to wit while the Sulphureous Particles, are kept in motion by the heat contracted in the Oven) afterwards, when this Maſs grows cold, it becomes heavy, weighty, and very cloſe: to wit, the aſcititious heat being exhaled, the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles, before carried forth, at length ſink down; and when the Particles of the reſt, not being excited into motion, the Maſs therefore becomes as it were Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentated: For in theſe kind of Subjects the Sulphureous Particles, becauſe they are very viſcous, hinder the motion of the reſt, nor can they themſelves perſiſt in motion, longer than they are forced, by the actual heat.</p>
                     <p>Bread is ſomtimes made of the flower of Wheat, or Barly, that is Germinated or Maulted, which without any Ferment added to it, becomes ſo exceeding hot, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contained in a compacted maſs, but that in the baking it ſpreads abroad: the reaſon of which is, in ſuch Flower, by the Maulting it, the active Principles are before placed in their vigor, and exaltation; wherefore in the kneaded Maſs, when they are urged, by the heat of the Oven, they run forth inordinately, and force the more thick parts, hindring them, and as it were fling them down head-long. We have ſaid enough of making Bread; we will now paſs to Beer.</p>
                     <p>Beer is made of Mault or Barly, germinated and dryed, which is performed after this manner: Firſt, the Barly is put into common water for three days, that it may intumifie or ſwell, then (the water being let out from it) it is flung in a heap upon a dry floor, moving it twice or thrice a day, leſt it grow too hot, until it begins to germinate, or bud forth, or put out little ſhoots of Roots. Afterwards, by frequent caſting it about, it is hindred from germinating or ſpringing forth any farther, and laſtly, being lay'd upon a Kiln, it is made dry by roſting it; by this means, it yields a meat wonderfully ſweet.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of this kind of proceſs is this; the Barly is permitted to ſpring forth, that its active Principles might be brought or ſet into their ſtrength, or exaltation: for when it germinates, the Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, at firſt aſleep, and ſluggiſh, do ſwell up or grow big together, and their ſluggiſhneſs being caſt off, they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to exerciſe their powers. The other preparations, hinder the Barly from ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating further, leſt that its Principles being very much looſned, ſhould exhale too much, and fly away from the Subject. The Meal of the Barly thus prepared grows ſweet, becauſe the active Principles are ſet in exaltation like Fruit brought to a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity: wherefore alſo the Liquor impregnated with this Meal, grows very turgid or big with Spirituous and Fermentative Particles; when the ſimple decoction of Barly, ſcarce Ferments at all, nor is kept long, but that it becomes muſty, and inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid.</p>
                     <p>But Beer is made after this manner; upon the Meal of the Barly, prepared as above ſaid, boyled water is poured, and is ſuffered to be macerated, or maſhed, for ſome hours, that it may be ſufficiently impregnated with the active Particles of the ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating Barly, now placed in their vigour: This Liquor being ſatisfied or filled, is drawn off clear from its ſetling, and is laſtly boyled, that it might get a ſomthing more thick conſiſtency, and be able to be kept the longer: Then, when it is ſomwhat cold, it is Fermented, a Ferment, or the flowring of Beer or Yeſt, being put thereto, and ſo tun'd up in a Barrel. Concerning its Fermentation, theſe things are eſpecial worthy of obſervation.</p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:107016:15"/>
                     <p>If it macerate with, or ſtand too long on, the Maulted Meal, the Liquor becomes thich and clammy; and afterwards will hardly Ferment or Work at all: the reaſon of this is, becauſe the active Principles, in this work, are of a prompt motion, and move together with them, the earthy Particles; with which, if by a long ſtay, the paſſages and pores of the Liquor are filled; being too full, they are wholly obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and as the contents in the Stomach, ſtuffed to a furfeit, ſcarcely Ferment at all.</p>
                     <p>If too hot, or too cold, the Liquor be put into the Barrel; as in the great heat of the Summer, or the cold in the Winter, Fermentation doth not rightly ſucceed: for by too much heat, the Particles are diſſipated one from another, that they cannot, mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually take hold of one another, and ſo work; by too much cold, they are bound up and fixed, that they ſcarce enter into motion, neither perform it ſtrongly.</p>
                     <p>When the Liquor of the Beer Ferments in the Vat, the active Principles do on every ſide explicate themſelves, they precipitate in the bottom the more thick, and Earthy, being partly driven as it were into flight, and partly ſticking to them, they lead them as it were Captive to the top, and there make hollow bubbles continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally growing up, and bring them as it were to ſervitude. After a due Fermentation, the whole ſpace of the Liquor is rendered clear and without dregs, in which the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits with a little Salt and Sulphur, do abound; in the mean time, in the ſettlement or dregs, a little of Spirit and Sulphur, with a greater plenty of Salt and Earth remains. So long as theſe ſhall be in their places the Liquor will be clear, ſweet, and Spirituous, but if long kept, or not ſhut up cloſely in a Barrel, great part of the Spirits will fly away: in the mean time, by the defect of theſe, the Saline Particles being exalted, and having gotten a Flux, impregnate the whole Liquor, and make it ſowr; for when Beer, as alſo Wine, goes into Vineger, it doth not happen becauſe they are wholly deprived of Spirits, (for ſo they would degenerate into a taſtleſs thing) but becauſe the Tartareous or Saline parts, are carried forth to a Flux, and infect the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor with their ſharpneſs; in the mean time, the Spirits being leſs in power, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that they cannot reſiſt them. Very hot weather, Thunder, the noiſe of great Guns, or the tunning it in the open Air, ſuddenly makes Beer grow ſowr, for by theſe means the Spirits being diſturbed in their equal motion, are diſſipated; and in the mean time, the Saline or Tartarous parts, being before ſeparated, and depreſſed, are moved, and carried forth into a Flux.</p>
                     <p>Indeed it plainly appears that the Spirituous parts in Vinegar, are not wholly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, but ſuppreſſed only whilſt the Saline are placed in a Flux; becauſe from Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, may be Diſtilled, a Liquor exceeding hot and burning, like the Spirit of Wine, after this manner: With the Diſtilled Vinegar, a Salt is extracted from Minium, or Lead Calcined, of which you have plenty, and ſhall diſtil it in a Retort, the Vinous and burning Spirit is driven into the Receiver; the reaſon of which is, becauſe when the Saline Particles of the Vinegar are united with the Salt of the Lead, the Vinous Spirits yet remaining are then freed; and having obtained their own right, they are urged from their lurking places by the heat of the Fire: but thoſe Spirits are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the Lead, becauſe if you give thereto a more vehement Fire, the Salt of the Lead, will be melted into a Metal.</p>
                     <p>But we will return to Beer, from whence we have digreſſed; to which, how great a perfection happens, by Fermentation, appears by this experiment. If you take Beer new made, not yet purged by Fermentation, and place it to be Diſtilled in a Bladder or Cucurbit; only a vapid or taſtleſs water aſcends, without any Spirits, and ſtrength at all: but if you proceed after the ſame manner with Beer truly Fermented, you will have a hot water, and highly Spirituous. And this takes away the objection of ſome, who ſay that water being even impregnated with the Meal of Mault, ſhould not be any more boyled, leſt the Spirits ſhould exhale; becauſe the Spirits, before Fermentation, are ſo obvolved with the more thick Particles of the reſt, that they cannot break forth from the Concrete.</p>
                     <p>The more the Beer is impregnated by the Mault, the ſtronger it is, keeps the longer without ſowring; which is helpt if Hops be boyled therein, from which at firſt it grows bitter, but afterwards recovers a grateful ſweetneſs; the reaſon of this is becauſe the pores of Liquor, which are empty of the Particles of the Meal, when they are poſſeſſed by thoſe of the Hops, the conſiſtency is made more compact, and is more full of Fermentative Particles; wherefore there is not quickly given any room for the Flux of the Salt. But that the Liquor being at firſt bitter, afterwards grows ſweet,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:107016:16"/>happens for this reaſon; becauſe the Spirituous and Sulphureous parts, ſupplyed by the Meal of the Mault, come not ſo ſoon to maturity, becauſe of the others mixed with them from the hops being boyled therein: but when this happens, that they grow to maturity, they eaſily excel all the others, and impart a ſweetneſs to the whole. Not only Hops being boyled in Beer, keep it long from ſowring, but alſo many other bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſharp things, do the ſame: for theſe, foraſmuch as they exceed in a Volatile Salt, hinder the flowings of others Salt; wherefore, ſome are wont to put into the Barrel, a piece of Saſſafraſs Wood, the tops of Wormwood, Broom, the Firr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Tree, the rinds of Oringes, alſo Spices in a ſmall quantity; by which means, the Drink, tho of a ſmaller ſubſtance, is kept a long while from ſowring. Thus much concerning the preparation of Beer, on the conſideration of which, (as alſo of Bread) we have ſtayed long, becauſe the word Fermentation is chiefly due to theſe. Let us paſs next to Wines. Excepting the Blood of Animals, there are no Liquors that grow hot, like Wines; there is found in none a greater plenty of Spirits, Salt, and Sulphur, or a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable turgeſcency, or ſwelling up. The Fermentation of Wines, and the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them Fermenting, are wont to be taught among the Vintners or Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Coopers, as a ſecret only to their Apprentices, or the Adepti of their Art. Among them there is delivered a certain Phyſical Science, or Method of Medicine, by which means, the impurities of Wines are purged forth, their heats attempered, or alſo their defect, or ſickneſs may be healed. There are many ways to be uſed, beſides that of ſophiſticating, as a ſecret, by which depauperated and taſtleſs Wines are ſold for ſound and rich. But as to our propoſition, that the Doctrine of Fermentation might be illuſtrated, theſe three things ought chiefly to be conſidered, concerning Wines: Firſt, Their deſaecation or cleaning, and their going into parts. Secondly, Their immoderate efferveſcency or growing hot, from what cauſes it is wont to be ſtirred up, and by what means to be ſuppreſſed. Thirdly, The declination of them, when they grow worſe: and by what remedies they are kept that they do not quickly paſs into a taſtleſneſs or Vinegar.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to Firſt, That Fermentation may beging in the Muſt, there is not (as in Beer) required, the putting to any Ferment, for the Juice being expreſſed from the Grapes, doth ſo greatly ſwell up with active Particles or Principles, that it preſently of its own accord, grows remarkably hot: but it is a uſual thing in ſome regions, when the Grapes are trod, to beſprinkle them with Quick Lime, by the provoking of which, as a Ferment, the Liquor preſſed forth, grows more fervent, and is ſooner purged. The Muſt or new Wine, is at firſt put into open Tubs, for that they cannot be contained in cloſe Veſſels, for their great heat or working, which ſo boyls up, that water over a Fire grows not more hot: when the Wine is a little cooler it is put into more cloſe Veſſels, in which it is further purged by Fermenting. In the purifying, the Spirituous and Subtile Particles greatly ſhake the more thick dregs, and diſmiſs them from themſelves on every ſide, that the Maſs of the Vinous Liquor, being made free from the mixture of the dregs, is rendred clear and without dregs. The Faeces or Lees of the Wine conſiſt of Salt and Sulphur, with a little Spirit and plenty of Earth; which whilſt the Wines grow hot, being ſeparated by degrees, either by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agulating themſelves mutually, are affixed to the ſides of the Veſſels under the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Tartar, or like Lees or Mother, ſettle to the bottom. In the mean time the Liquor ſwimming over them, is very clear and exceeding Spirituous.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes the defecation or clearing of Wines is hardly brought about, as a Vinous Liquor is not eaſily freed from the mixture of Tartar: wherefore Vintners are wont to put to the Wines ſome Bodies that either clear them, or precipitate them, ſo as the Earthy matter ſwimming in them, may ſooner ſettle to the bottom: The things which ſo clarifie Wines are of two ſorts: for they have either viſcous parts, as Clew, the Whites of Eggs and ſuch like, which ſtick cloſe to the faeculencies of the Wine with laying faſt hold on them, and carry them with themſelves towards the bottom: Or elſe they abound in a precipitatory ſtrength, which while they enter into the pores of the Liquor, thruſt forth the more thick Particles from thence, and ſtrike them down to the bottom; as are the duſt of Alabaſter, Calcined Flints, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Wines tho at firſt they were well cleared, yet afterwards they conceive immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate efferveſcencies, ſo that the Tartar, being ſtirred up from the bottom, it at length mingled with them; alſo the Spirits being looſened, now the Sulphureous Particles, now the Saline being too much carried forth, render the Wines unſavory, clammy
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:107016:16"/>or ſowr. We will conſider theſe things, from what Cauſes they come to be ſo, and by what means they are Cured.</p>
                     <p>Wines very often contract heats, when they are full of Tartar or too rich Lees: For Tartar or Lees, tho ſeparated from the Liquor of the Wine, and depreſſed to the bottom of the Veſſel, yet for that they conſiſt of plenty of Salt and Sulphur, they ſtill ſend from themſelves Fermentative Particles, by the inſpiration of which the Wine is kept in an equal motion of Fermentation: and as the Wines are leaſurely ripened, ſo the Salt and Sulphur which lurk in the Tartar, are by little and little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted; until at length, being carried forth to a Flox, they infect the Vinous Liquor, with a troubled feces or dregs, and compel it to grow immoderately hot, andn to boil up. Againſt theſe too great heats of Wines, there is neceſſity, that they be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently drawn off or rack'd, from this too rich Lees, and put into another Veſſel, or elſe it comes to paſs, by reaſon of its too great diſturbance, the Sulphur being very much exalted, that they become unſavory and ropy; or the Spirit being loſt, and the Salt carried forth to a Flux, they contract a fowrneſs, and turn to Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>Neither doth Wine grow more hot than it ſhould do, only from Tartar, or too rich Lees, but by too great agitation, immoderate heat, or by an extraneous or ſtrange Body put to it, and not miſcible, or that cannot mingle with it: for by theſe and other ways, the Sulphureous part of the Wine grows hot, and from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives ceives a fervour, and undue boyling up; for the ſetling of which, beſides the racking or drawing it off, from one Veſſel into another, they uſe to pour plenty of Milk, into the Pipe or Barrel, by whoſe mixture the heats and tumults of the Wines are preſently appeaſed; but as by this means the Spirits of the Wine are very much overcome, it cannot keep long, but ſoon after degenerates to Vinegar or without taſt; therefore the Vintners are neceſſitated to ſell preſently the Wines mended by this Artifice, and very ſuddenly to draw them off.</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of heats of Wines, tho they be timely appeaſed, before they wholly ſpoyl the Wines, yet they leave ſome viciouſneſs, by which the Vinous Liquor is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from its due colour and conſiſtency, and is mande leſs grateful to the Palate: for Wines made hot, oftentimes become of a more deep colour, <hi>viz.</hi> they degenerate from a watery and clear colour, to a Citron or Red, and give to the taſt a rankneſs; all which indeed proceed, from the Sulphur being too much carried forth and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: For theſe kind of diſtempers of Wines, they proceed after this manner; for the mending the colour, oftentimes ſimple Milk, or boiled with Glew or fine Flour, is poured into the Hogſhead or Pipe; for theſe procure a certain ſeparation of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Sulphur, and with its whiteneſs give clearneſs, or reſtore the colour to a bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Mucilaginous, clammy, or ropy Wines, are amended by the infuſion of burnt Alum, quick Lime, Gypſum or Plaſter of Walls, Salt and the like; for theſe cauſe a new Fermentation, that the more thick Particles are thruſt forth from the reſt, and precipitated towards the bottom. The unſavouryneſs is helped by the ſame means.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As to the third propoſition; Wines are depauperated or made poor, when by a long efferveſcency the Spirit and more pure Sulphur, being exhaled, the Saline Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles begin to be exalted: in this caſe their languiſhing ſtrength is ſuſtained with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain remedies, as it were Cordials.</p>
                     <p>As the Spirit and Sulphur being too much carried forth, and exalted, is cured by the drawing off the Wines from the rich Lees: So the ſame being depreſſed, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is that they be put to a more rich Tartar or Lees: wherefore the Vintners, are wont to pour the depauperated Wines, deſtitute of plenty of Spirits and Sulphur, and which begin to grow ſowr, by reaſon of the Salts being carried forth to ſound and freſh Lees or Tartar; that they might as it were anew inſpired with Spirit and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, ferment and recover new ſtrength and vigor, beſides they make Syrups of generous and rich Wines, with Sugar and Spices, which they pour among the ſtale and deadiſh Wines. Further. for Wines turning to Vinegar, they are ſaid to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter profitably, ſome other remedies. <hi>Gratarolus</hi> praiſes with many more, Lard and Swines fleſh ſalted, wrapt in Linnen, and put into the Cask: and truly it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Sulphureous odor of this doth reſtrain the Flux of the ſowring Salt; for this end the ſame Author commends Leek-Seed, Pine-Nuts, blanched Wheat, boiled Wine, Aſhes, the ſhavings of Willow, and many others, for the Salt readily acts on theſe kind of Subjects, and ſpends its force; even as Virgins ſick of the Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſickneſs,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:107016:17"/>deſire greedily to eat ſuch like abſurd things, that may ſatisſie the extrane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and for the moſt part ſowriſh Ferment of the Ventricle, but very hurtful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. There remains another kind of Cure, whereby ſmall Wines almoſt corrupted, and growing vapid or ſmachleſs, recover new vigor for a time, to wit, a portion of Rheniſh Wine, or others, very Fermentable, is laid up, and hindred from Ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from whence it is made a perpetual Muſt (commonly called Stum) if a little of this Liquor be poured into a Cask of ſtale Wine, and jogged together, it gives a freſh, and new Fermentation to the whole: ſo that that Wine will froth and boyl, and ſhut in a Glaſs will leap forth; but the drink mended by this Artifice, is accounted very unwholſom, for that it is apt to ſtir up an immoderate Fermentation in our blood: wherefore it is prohibited by Edict, that the Wine-Coopers or Vintners make not uſe of this kind of Sophiſtication.</p>
                     <p>It is uſual thing alſo, to ſtop up cloſe, in Stone or Glaſs Bottles, for a time, ſmall Wines, and new Ale or Beer, which being afterwards opened, the Liquor ferments ſo impetuouſly, that being almoſt all rarified into froth, it flies forth of the Bottles: which beſides contracts ſuch an acrimony or ſharp cutting, that it can ſcarce be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: The reaſon of which (as it ſeems) is this: The turgency or ſwelling up, and the notable acetoſity, ſharpneſs, or quickneſs of thſe kind of Liquors, proceeds chiefly from the Salt being exalted, and having gotten a Flux; for when as the Liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of much Tartar and little Spirit, is ſhut up cloſe in a Veſſel, all the Particles together are forced to be fermented, and when they cannot be ſeparated, and fly away from one another, they do the more trouble one another, and break themſelves into ſmall bits; that by this means the bond of the mixture may be wholly broken; but the little bodies looſened one from another, and as it were freed by reaſon of the cloſeneſs of the Veſſel, are forced together: wherefore when the Veſſel is opened, all the Particles at once being ready for flight, like Air ſuddenly rarified, break forth with noiſe and tumult; and becauſe the Saline parts having gotten a Flux, by reaſon of the plenty of Tartar, are ſtronger than the Spirit and Sulphur, from thence the nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cutting ſharpneſs is cauſed in the Liquor.</p>
                     <p>Cyder comes next to the Nature of Wine, to wit, of the ſmaller ſort, which kind of Liquor, is only the Juice preſſed from Apples, and brought to maturity by Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation: concerning this kind of Drink, it is worth obſervation, that if it be made of Summer Fruit, or too much ripened, it will not keep in ſtrength, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently degenerates into a deadneſs: but if it be prepared of very unripe, and ſowr Apples, it contracts a bitterneſs, for that the Spirits do not ſufficiently ariſe in this, but give place to the Salt, having firſt gotten a Flux: but in the other, they are not long enough retained, but wholly fly away, before the maſs of the Liquor attains to full Fermentation: but there are Fruits and Apples, exceeding fit for this buſineſs, which being indued with a more firm conſiſtency, are not quickly corrupted, neither do they attain their perfect maturity or ſoftneſs, but of a long time: The Juice of theſe wrung forth, and put into a Cask, does not grow hot, as Beer, with a great frothy head, but after the manner of Wines, with a noiſe, like a Pot boyling over the Fire: whilſt Fermenting after this manner, it is made clear, the more light recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are carried upwards, and remain in the Superficies, as the flowering: but the more thick parts and Tartarous ſettle plentifully in the botteom; but the more ſolid Cruſt, or Cogulated Tartar, is not fixed to the ſides of the Veſſel: which is a ſign Cyder is a more wholſom Drink, nor ſo infeſtous to the nervous ſtock, becauſe it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds leſs with a ſharp Salt than ſmall Wines. The Liquor ſwimming over theſe Faeces or Lees ſettling in the bottom, enjoys it as it were its food, and is kept by its inſpiration in ſtrength; from which if it chance to be drawn forth, it quickly grows ſowr: for indeed this kind of Drink, is in great danger to be deſtroyed by the Flux, or ſowmeſs of the Salt: againſt this il, to preſerve it, ſome are wont to caſt into the Caks Muſtard Seed bruiſed, or Muſtard Balls, for that the Volatile Salt of this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the Flux of the acetous Salt, ſo that the Liquot thereby preſently grows clear, and keeps the longer: another kind of remedy againſt the ſowrneſs of Cider, is, that as ſoon as it begins to grow ſowr, it be drawn off from its Lees, and kept in cloſe ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Bottles, with a little Sugar; for by this means it ferments anew, and becauſe, together with the Flux of the Salt, the Spirits being carried forth, are deteined from flight, a very grateful ſharpneſs is cauſed to the whole Liquor. Alſo, almoſt by the ſame preparation, and the like proceſs of Fermentation, a potalbe Liquor is made out of Pears, which is however above meaſure ſweet, and if plentifully drunk, renders the Belly looſe, as if they had taken Phyſick.</p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="tcp:107016:17"/>
                     <p>So much for Fermenting Liquors, whoſe virtue conſiſts in the Spirit being carried forth, and obtaining the height of perfection: there remains other preparations, whoſe vigor is placed in the Saline part being exalted, and having gotten a Flux; among theſe, Vinegar is of chiefeſt note, the way of making of which, being wholly unlike the aforementioned, requires a method of Fermentation, very different from thoſe before deſcribed: for example, ſmall Wines, or more generous or ſtrong Beer, being put up into the Cask, are expoſed in the Summer time, for a long while to the Suns Beams, or elſe in the Winter, they are kept near a Stove in ſome hot place; after this manner, whilſt ſome Spirits evaporate, the reſt being put under the yoak, the Saline parts are exalted and infect the whole Maſs of the Liquor with their ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but not only Wines long kept, or Stale Beer, out of which the Spirits of their own accord, begin to go away, but freſh Muſt, or new Beer, paſs after this manner into Vinegar; for the Country-women are wont to place without doors all the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, ſtrong Ale, and hghly impregnated with Mault, in a Cask, by which means they make an exceeding biting and moſt penetrating Vinegar.</p>
                     <p>Yea after the ſame manner almoſt, our kind of Hydromels, Honnied Drink, or Meath are wont to be prepared: to wit, they boyl ſixteen parts of Water with one part of Hony, to the conſumption of a third part, adding then ſome Spices, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſharp Ferment, they place the Cask and Liquor for many days in the Sun, and after wards in a Wine-Cellar. It ſeems the Sunning of it is uſed, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Saline parts being brought towards a Flux, might ſomwhat reſtrain the nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweetneſs of the Hony: and by that means the ſweet being tempered with ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, a moſt pleaſing taſt is afforded to this Drink.</p>
                     <p>By reaſon of the ſharpneſs ariſing from the Flux of the Salt, alſo very many eatable things are wont to be prepared after various manners; hence the fleſh of living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and eſpecially of Fiſhes when they ſwell with too much Sulphur, are pickled with Salt Brine or ſharp Liquors, that the Salt being brought forth, they may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more grateful to the Stomach. It would be a tedious brſineſs to inſiſt here on particulars; but I will in this place deſcribe a certain noted kind of Oaten Broth, Crewel, or Flumery, which profitably nouriſhes Feveriſh, alſo Conſumptive and Hectick people.</p>
                     <p>This kind of Drink, that it many become gratefully ſowriſh, the Meal of Oats is put into common water for about three days, till it acquire a ſomwhat ſowr taſt: then, this infuſion is placed upon the fire, and with a Ladle is ſtirred about until it boyls, and when it riſes up ready to flow over the Veſſel, it muſt then be poured forth into a platter, and preſently cooled; it will appear like Gelly, and may be cut into bits; which if heated ſoon melts. In this preparation may be obſerved, that by a long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Grain, the Saline parts being brought forth, do get a Flux; then theſe ſo impregnate the Liquor that the more thick Particles being by the heat brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to its pores and paſſages, they are ſo ſtrictly ſhut up, that they cannot eaſily ſink down, but that the whole mixture becomes like Gelly.</p>
                     <p>It would alſo be too great labour to heap together here, the various Condites and kinds of Pickles, for it would be to deſcribe under that rank the whole Art of Cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Diet. For in both the only aim is, that for healths ſake and for pleaſure, the active Particles in our food. may be placed in their vigor and exaltation; for ſo they greatly pleaſe the Palate, and by a more eaſie digeſtion go into nouriſhment: for this reaſon, not only Drinks, and Conſections of Corn, and Herbs of a diverſe nature and kind are thought on; but alſo we variouſly prepare fleſh, both boyled and roſted, and add to them ſauces, that the Particles, now the Spiritous, now the Saline, being carried forth to a Flux, might pleaſe the taſt, with a certain ſharpneſs. Thoſe which are of a more fixed nature, are brought to exaltation, by Sauces made of Sugar, Salt, or Pepper. They are wont to keep ſome fleſh almoſt to putrefaction, that by that means, the active Particles being place din their ſtrength and motion, may become of a more grateful taſt. Here might be in terwoven, a long diſcourſe concerning Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal Compoſitions, but becauſe this ſubject, deſerves a peculiar conſideration, I will ſay nothing more of it here. Let us next ſee by what motion of Fermentation and Habitude of Principles, Natural Bodies tend towards diſſolution; or what is the progreſs of every thing to Putrefaction and Corruption.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, which is obſerved in the Death, alſo in the Putrefaction and Corruption of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>NAtural Bodies in which Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, are found in but a mean quantity, do not ſtay long in the ſame ſtate: for theſe active Principles are employed perpetually in motion: As ſoon as they come together, they tend from Crudity and Confuſion towards Perfection, for the fake of which, when they have reach'd the height, they are able to come to, they are not quiet in this point; but from thence they make haſt towards the diſſolution of that thing. Thoſe which are more volatile do firſt of all break forth from the looſened bond of the mixture; then the reſt ſeparate into parts, until the form of the mixture wholly periſhes: The Spirit being carried forth to the top, flies away firſt with the water, and the more pure Sulphur, and by its expiration, diffuſes a very grateful odor; afterwards the more thick Sulphur, with the Salt, being looſened from the band wherewith they were tyed, and having gotten a Flux, by degrees evaporate, and together diſperſe a very ſtinking ſmell: together with theſe, the water parts flow forth, and the frame of the ſubject breaks, or falls down into Earth or a <hi>Caput Mortuum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kind of proceſs may be obſerved both in natural things, and alſo in Subjects prepared by Art: Concerning Natural things, the disjunction of the Elements, and their ſeparation into parts, may be ſeen both in the death of living Bodies, or the extinction of life and vegetation; and alſo in the corruption of them being dead, and in their reduction to a rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>As in Vegetables, the growth and maturity depend on the combination and mutual cleaving together of the Principles, ſo the decay and death depend on their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſunder, and ſeparation, in Plants and Fruits; being by degrees cxalted from a crude and ſowr Juice by Spirit and Sulphur, they come to maturity; to which a ſweet taſt and ſmell, and a pleaſant colour happen: then preſently the ſame matter, the Spirit and Sulphur, and the reſt of the Elements leiſurely flying away from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, is ſoon reduced to a filthineſs and rottenneſs: If after the ſubtil and more pure Particles of Spirits and Sulphur are flown away, there ſtill remain plenty of Earth and Salt, with ſome Sulphur, the matter does not putrifie, but grows dry with an hoarineſs: but if the thick Salt and Sulphur, having gotten a Flux, break forth from the Subject, together with the reſt, the bond of the mixture being looſened, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently the external humidity, poſſeſſes the ſpaces left by theſe, and the Body is reſolved into rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Alſo all Animals whatſoever, have ſet bounds of their growth and duration: For they aſcend from their beginning, by ſlow increaſe, to motion and ſen ation; then to the ſtrength and exaltation of Nature: in which point they ſtay not, but from thence, by equal ſteps, make haſt towards their fall.</p>
                     <p>If the cauſe of this kind of limitation be required, we ſay that Mother Mature hath placed in the primigenious ſeed of every thing, ſuch a ſtock of Spirit, Salt and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, which might ſuffice for the producing the utmoſt thrids or lineaments of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: ſo that the growth and aſcent of the thing, to its height or <hi>acme</hi> is only an evolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or unrowling of that radical matter, and protenſion or ſtretching it ſelf forth into a greater dimenſion; in the mean time the little ſpaces and vacuities, which are made by the protraction of this matter, are filled up by the active Particles, ſupplyed by Nutrition, which alſo by a continual ſeries of motion are ripened, exhaled, and give place to others ſucceeding. As ſoon as this ſeminal matter is unfolded and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to the height, that it cannot be moved, or expanded further, the matter is then brought to the ſtate of its perfection: from thence ſome Particles of this Radical ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, together with the ſecondary ſupplyed from the Nouriſhment, begin to evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; and others dayly, and then others, being after this manner conſumed, both
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:107016:18"/>the ſolid parts, by degrees decreaſe in their ſubſtance, as alſo the Nutritious Juice and Blood, even decline for the worſe, till by a long waſting, the props of the Body, are made dry or withered, and the blood ſo depauperated, that it will not ſuffice for ſuſtenance to the vitalfire: juſt as it may be perceived in a Lamp, if the Oyl being continually conſumed, in its place be put water, the Liquor is rendered poor, and diluted, that it is not able any longer, to cheriſh at all the flame of the wick.</p>
                     <p>When the Life of animals periſhes, (either it expires after the aforeſaid manner leiſurely, and like a Candle or Lamp is extinguiſhed, the Oyl or Tallow being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; or it is choaked by a haſty death, being ſnatched away by Fate, or the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of a Diſeaſe) preſently the Spirits, with Salt and Sulphur, flowing together in the blood; and alſo planted in every part, ceaſe from their regular motion, and are moved into confuſion: then they partly exhale from the pores, with the vaniſhing heat, and partly being ſhut up within in the Cavities, inordinately Ferment, with the remaining Particles, and make a ſwelling up of the inwards, and of the whole Body. But afterwards the frame of the ſolid parts being by degrees looſened, and the Sulphureous Particles, together with the Saline, having gotten a Flux, begin to eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate; from thence a ſtrong ſtink and corruption ariſe. The active Principles, breaking forth by heaps, do often mutually take hold of one another, and being combined in the ſuperficies of the Carcaſe, produce Worms: at length when they are wholly exhaled from the Subject, what remains ſalls into duſt.</p>
                     <p>It is a uſual thing for Worms to be generated in Vineger when it is corrupted and loſt its ſtrength, which being exceeding ſmall; and ſomwhat long and ſmooth like Eels, ſwim in the Liquor, and may by the help of Glaſs be expoſed to our Eyes; theſe beeing ſeen, it is commonly ſaid, that the ſharpneſs and pricking of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger proceeds from theſe little Creatures, which is a vain thought that deſerves not a refutation; for they are only to be found in dead Vineger; and I pray from whence have they their teeth ſufficient for the gnawing of Iron? But the whole corroſive force of Vineger is more truly referred to the Salf having gotten a Flux: in the mean time thoſe little Creatures ſeem to be begotten by this means; it is ſufficiently known, that when very many Subjects are brought to putrefaction, the active Principles being thruſt out of doors, yet ſtill affecting their old dwelling, remain ſomwhere about the neighbourhood, and being joyned together, do often produce living Bodies; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when moiſt things putrifie, moſt often little Worms grow on their Superficies; but in Vineger the buſineſs is a little different, to wit, becauſe the Elementary parit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are more fixed, therefore when the mixture of the Liquor is wholly diſſolved, the active Principles, although looſened, yet breaking very hardly and difficultly from the ſubſtance, meet together in the bowels of the Subject, and there mutually cheriſhing one another, cauſe thoſe little Creatures in the midſt of the waters.</p>
                     <p>Alſo the Bodies of living Creatures, being prepared for our Food, are diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards putrefaction, if they are put up for ſome days, till the active Particles are looſened, and begin to be in motion, tending to exhalation; wherefore both the Fleſh becomes more flaccid, and in eating more tender and ſoft: and if they are kept longer, till the Saline and Sulphureous parts being carried forth into a Flux, do break out, preſently a ſtinking ſmell and putrefaction is induced.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways whereby fleſh is wont to be kept from putrefaction; the chief of which are, that it be pickled with Salt or Spices. Things are kept a long time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt and very grateful to the taſt, with Salt: Dead Carkaſes are imbued with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they may remain a long while in their Sepulchers. As to the firſt, Brine or ſalt Pickle hinders the eruption of the Sulphur, and fixes it in the Subject by its em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracement, and retains it. Spices, as they conſiſt of very active Principles, ſtir up a new Ferment in the Subject, the dead Carcaſe; and the implanted Elements of this, joyn into the ſociety of their motion, and retain many of their Particles flying away, yet longer in the body: As Salt and Spices are made uſe of for the preſerving long fleſh, and Sulphureous things, (which alſo preſerve all other things from Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction) ſo Vegetables, and their Flowers and Fruits are better conſerved with Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar: for this by cheriſhing the active Particles of the Subject, reſtrains them within, and beſides, renders the Confections, of a very grateful taſt.</p>
                     <p>Minerals, chiefly the ſolid and hard, becauſe they are indued with plenty of Salt and Earth, with little of Sulphur, and with a leſs quantity of Spirits, therefore they rarely, or not at all conceive Putrefaction: there is the ſame reaſon for reſionous things, which tho they abound in Sulphur, with Salt and Earth, yet becauſe there is but a
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:107016:19"/>ſmall portion of Water and Spirits, therefore their frame is not eaſily looſened, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they obnoxious to Putrefaction. Among Minerals, Common-water only, falls under this rank: for this, if it ſtand ſtill, or is kept long in a Veſſel, its Salt and Sulphur, though but in a little quantity, having gotten a Flux, begin to evaporate, and together to induce Putrefaction: but ſo long as water is in motion, theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles are ſtill involved with others, and ſo by their mutual embrace, are detained from evaporation.</p>
                     <p>Artificial things and preparations, are no leſs ſubject to Putrefacton than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural things; for Bread, and all manner of Eatable things or Food, Wine, Beer, and other Drinkable Liquors, alſo Medicinal Confections, being long kept, firſt loſe their ſtrength and vigor, and then afterwards are Corrupted: concerning which, we may obſerve theſe following things.</p>
                     <p>The more the things are Compounded, and have all the principles conjoyned to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the ſooner, and the eaſier, do they enter into Putrefaction; wherefore Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able things, prepared of Fleſh, Broths, Decoctions of Herbs, alſo many Medicines made after the Calenical way, are wont) unleſs preſerved with very much Salt or Sugar) to be Corrupted in a ſhort time: In the mean time, Diſtillations, and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Preparations, which conſiſt of Homogeneous, or not much different Particles, are kept ſound a long while.</p>
                     <p>In Compounded things, if there be too great quantity of water, things ſooner putrefie, for ſo the frame of the mixture is too looſe; ſo that the fixed Principles cannot take hold of the Volatile, or keep them back from flight: but thoſe in which Spirits abound with moderate Salt and Sulphur, if they are kept in a cloſe Veſſel, that they may evaporate but little, continue a long time, as may be perceived by ſtrong or generous Wine. The next to theſe, are thoſe things which are preſerved with Hony or Sugar, or in which the Saline Particles are in in great plenty be Nature.</p>
                     <p>Many of theſe, whilſt they are corrupted, are either made Moldy or Rank, or they grow ſowr, or degenerate into a vapidneſs, or without taſt: things are made Moldy, when the ſubtil Particles in the exhaling, are deteined by the more thick, and cleaving together by their mutual embrace on the Superficies of the body, grow into a ſoft Down or Hoarineſs, even as Moſs is brought forth by Stones or Wood expoſed to moiſture.</p>
                     <p>Rankneſs or unſavory Taſt, happens chiefly in Sulphureous things, for Oyly and Fat things, by Heat or Age, become Muſty or Unſavory, to wit, when the Spirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very much exhaled, the Sulphureous Particles are two much exalted, and begin to evaporate.</p>
                     <p>Sharpneſs or Acidity is induced from the Salt, being to much carried forth and looſened, for when the Spirit is depreſſed, or exhaled, the Salt being fuſed, conceives a Flux, and ſo brings in a Sowrneſs: hence Wine, Beer, Cydar, alſo Milk, very many Eatable things, and the Juices of Herbs, when they are long kept, or if they are moved by too immoderate heat of the Air, or ſhaking, do eaſily grow Sowr.</p>
                     <p>Liquid things, degenerate into a vapidneſs or taſtleſneſs, when the active Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, are for the moſt part gon forth, and nothing eminent beſides Water and Earth, or of the ſubtile parts, is left in the Subject.</p>
                     <p>That I may contract what is aforeſaid; the corruption of every thing, is only the ſeparation and departure of themſelves from one another into parts of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples before combined, (the bond of the mixture being looſened) which motion, by reaſon of the diverſe diſpoſition of their breaking forth, (either with or without a ſtink) ends in Putrefaction or Rottenneſs.</p>
                     <p>Where Spirits abound, and that there is alſo plenty of Sulphur and Salt, and the Particles being looſened from their bonds, break forth in heaps; the mixture putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies with a ſtink; alſo if it conſiſt of a thick ſubſtance, ſo that all the parts are not rightly ventilated, it conceives a heat from the Putrefaction: in ſuch a Corruption, the ſtink proceeds from the exhalation of the ſharp pointed Sulphur, or made prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Salt: Putrefaction follows, for that the external humidity, enters into the place of the Particles flying away: But the heat is produced by the Sulphureous Particles being moved together in heaps, and being ſhut up within the Subject, that they gather together, and being united act more ſtrongly. But if there be ing the Subject a leſſer proportion of Salt and Sulphur, ſo that when the mixture is looſened, the Particles are moved more ſlowly, and evaporate leiſurely; the Body grows dry, and is reduced to a waſting, without any ill ſmell, Putrefaction or Heat.</p>

                     <p>It will not be from the purpoſe to inquire in this place, from whence ſome empty Veſſels, and more moiſt bodies, by lying long, conceive a certain ſtink without Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction; alſo other things being put into them, or lying near them, are wont to partake of their Evil; for which affection, a proper Latin word is not eaſily to be met with; in our Idiom it is called Muſtineſs, and in ſome ſort ſeems to be deſigned by the word <hi>Mucor,</hi> unleſs that <gap reason="foreign">

The conſideration of this matter is not improperly referred to the Doctrine of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for this Tincture or Impreſſion of a ſtink, unfolds it ſelf far abroad, as if it were a certain Ferment, that the Veſſel but lightly imbued with it, infects whatever Liquors are put into it, and infuſions of them, even new and often iterated; we may obſerve a twofold effect of this thing: For ſomtimes the Veſſels being almoſt empty, at firſt vitiated, afterwards infect moſt Liquors, which they by chance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, with a muſty odor: ſomtimes more moiſt compacted, and ſolid things, being kept long, ſomwhat cloſe in a Cellar, contract this vice of their own accord; when in the mean time the contagion is not perceived to be in the place where they were kept; which things either may become muſty, not becauſe they are corrupted, for in moſt Spirit, Salt, and Sulphur, being yet contained, in the bond of mixture, the frame of the matter is kept whole, but the vice only conſiſts in this, that from the Subjects after this manner diſpoſed, <hi>effuvia's</hi> as it were aculeated or ſharpned fall off, and therefore become ungrateful to our ſmell and taſt.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, that any Veſſel may conceive a muſtineſs, there ſeems to be required in the firſt place, that is in ward hollowneſs be large, and its mouth narrow; th wit, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a paſſage may lie open to the outward Air, and reſt may be granted to it being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in: for Juggs with broad mouths, alſo Bottles cloſe ſhut, do not eaſily get this fault. Secondly, that beſides the more ample inward hollowneſs, the ſides of the Veſſel be indued with pores, and very ſmall paſſages; for in theſe kind of little ſpaces be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with humour, the Air being ſtrictly ſhut up, remains more quiet, and is apt to ſtagnate: Wherefore Glaſs Bottles are not ſo apt to ſuffer this evil as Wooden, or Stone Bottles. Thirdly, that ſome moiſture, tho very little, ſtick about the ſides of the Veſſel, or in its bottom, whereby the Air being entred may be intangled: for if the Bottles be hung up, with their mouth downwards, that all moiſture may drein out, they will never be muſty.</p>
                     <p>In the ſecond place: when Bodies, without any contagion of a Veſſel, contract a muſtineſs or moldineſs of their own accord, we may obſerve, firſt, that they are of that kind, which conſiſt of Heterogeneous Particles, that is, a mixture of all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements together; becauſe the parts of Vegetables and Animals, and preparations of them, eaſily receive this evil; Minerals for the moſt part remain free from it: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that there be plenty of humidity in the concrete, for the more dry continue a long while without any hurt: Thirdly, that the Bodies be either kept in a heap un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved for a long time, or elſe in ſome cloſe Cupbord, or Cellar, without Air; for ſo Wheat or Grain, in a heap, unleſs it be often moved, as alſo all Eatable things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put up in a cloſe place quickly grow muſty.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions we conjecture, that muſtineſs is made an affection to a moiſt inanimate Body, from the ambient Air, being admitted within its pores, and being got in there ſtagnating, whereby the Elementary Particles of that mixture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing combined together with thoſe ſent in by the Air, are exalted into the Nature of a Ferment; that they diffuſe themſelves on every ſide with wonderful activity, and their <hi>effuvia's,</hi> as it were ſharpned, ungratefully ſtrike againſt the ſenſories of the taſt and ſmell. When therefore, ſome Subject becomes primarily muſty, a certain portion of the Air placed near, and hindred from ventilation, enters into its pores and paſſages, and there being intangled with a tenacious matter, is wholly ſhut up within the ſubſtance of that Concrete. From the mixture of the ſhut-up Air, the implanted little Bodies of the matter, eſpecially the Sulphureous and Saline, acquire new heads; that afterwards, when they are exactly to be mixed with no other Body, yet very greatly Fermentative, tho intermingled with any other thing, retain their own Nature, and being diffuſed through the large ſubſtance of the matter, infect the whole; to wit, they diſpoſe by that means, the Particles of that new matter, that they being armed with ſharp points, bring in like manner a trouble to our ſenſes: But in the mean time, from the muſtineſs, whether primarily ariſen, or received by Contagion, the mixture of the thing is not diſſolved, nor the Principles diſſipated;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:107016:20"/>yea thoſe things which are wholly taſtleſs, do ſcarce at any time become muſty: the muſty ſmell depends chiefly on the active Principles, diſpoſed by a peculiar rite, by the involved Air and their <hi>effluvia's;</hi> wherefore if they almoſt wholly fly away from any Subject, that is rendred almoſt incapable of this affection.</p>
                     <p>There may be obſerved a certain likeneſs between muſtineſs and an Empyreuma, or taſt of fire or burnt-too, for as in this, the Particles of the fire being intangled, and included by a tenacious matter, by their long ftaly there, pervert the implanted little Bodies of Salt and Sulphur, from wherece their <hi>effluvia's,</hi> ſtrike our Senſes with an ingrateful ſharpneſs; moreover, being mingled with other things, they affix to them, the diſpoſition of their pravity; ſo in muſtineſ, the Particles of the Air, being obvolved with a viſcous matter, and ſtagnating, they change by their preſence the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and Sulphureous little Bodies, from their due temper, whereby they being as it were gifted with ſharp preckings, do ſtrike bitterly our ſenſories, and being exceeding Fermentative, diffuſe their Odor to others: the alteration being either way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, can ſcarce be blotted out, by any mixture with other things, or emendation by Art: The chief means of helping of either, is by placing it in a reciprocal traje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>viz.</hi> Empyreumatical things, or taſting of the fire, are to be a long while ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a more moiſt Air, whereby the Particles of the Fire may exhale: and muſty things are to be held to the Fire, or put to ſuch things which may ſweeten their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to wit, quick Lime, Sulphur, or Srygian waters, by which the parts of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air are driven away, and ſo the remaining little Bodies of the mixture are wont to recover their priſtine ſtate; wherefore, if muſty Liquors are diſtilled, the water falling into the Receiver, will be deprived of that ſtink: But the ſmatch of Fire or Empyreuma, is not ſo eaſily mended by this Artifice.</p>
                     <p>So much for Fermentation, and the motion of the Principles, for as much as within the Confines of the ſame Subject, they diſpoſe it, either to maturity and perfection, or to wards diſſolution and corruption. It now follows to treat of the motion of the ſame kind of Particles and Principles, for as much as ſome of one Body do act on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of another Body, and by diſſolving the mixture, do wholly draw them forth, and ſend them outward, or by precipitating it cauſe them to go into parts.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, as much as is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Diſſolution of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>FOR the Solution of Bodies, there are two great ſolvencies, or Menſtrua, which exiſt from Nature, to wit, Water and Fire: Fire, if it be next and immediately applyed, deſtroys moſt Bodies, drives away the Princlples one from another, and as it were diſſipates them into Air, Earth only, with a little Salt, being left behind; if it be mediately applied, it brings awsy ſome Particles, ſo that in the mean time others remain: After which manner it ſerves chiefly for Diſtillations, and Chymical Operations, and is alſo uſed in the Preparation of neceſſaries for our Food, both about the Boyling and Roſting of Meats. Water does not ſo readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy Bodies, but it draws forth ſome parts from the Subjects, and receives them into its own Boſom, and firmly retains them for various uſes: But as it does not eaſily pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate every Body, but leaves almoſt untouched thoſe which are of a more fixed Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, various ways are thought of, whereby the Menſtruum of water is made ſharper, and is rendred fit for the diſſolving of any Bodies whatſoever. For by means of the Bodies, which it ought to diſſolve, and of the parts which it ought to receive in it ſlef, it is armed as it were with ſome Weapons; with which it is able to unlock any Subject, and to poſſeſs now theſe, now thoſe Particles. The Menſtruum of water is ſharpned with Spirit, Salt, or Sulphur: to wit, either with each of theſe, or with more of them joyned together; we will firſt ſpeak of the watery Menſtruum, with the various ſharpning of it, and afterwards of the fiery diſſolvent.</p>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:107016:20"/>
                     <p>Common water moſt caſily diſſolves the more ſimple Bodies, except sulphur; and hides their Particles, in its pores and paſſages; it readily receives Salts of every kind, and eaſily imbibes Spirits; it looſens the frame of Earth, and cheriſhes its more the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der little bodies, in its embrace; but it is hardly mixed with Fat, and Oyly things, and receives not their Particles, but by the coming between of others, but drives them forth to its Superficies, as not miſcible, or thruſts them down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
                     <p>Water in ſome meaſure enters the more compounded Bodies, whoſe frame is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what looſe; and then receives into its boſom, ſome not ſimple Particles, but reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling the nature of the whole mixture: hence moſt Vegetables, alſo parts of living creatures, and ſome Minerals, being put into common water, do impregnate it with a certain virtue; and from moſt Metals, by a long maceration, it takes away ſome ſtrength, though but ſmall. Some Bodies are diſſolved by water, which yet a Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous or Spirituous Menſtrua leave almoſt untouch'd; as the Gums <hi>Tragacanth, Arabic,</hi> &amp;c. alſo Salts and Sugar.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and moſt common way of ſharpning, whereby ſimple water may more eaſily enter the Bodies to be diſſolved, is, that it be furniſhed with fiery Particles, or darts of adventitious heat; for ſo it is driven more deeply with a certain force, into Bodies, and deſtroys ſome thrids, as it were the ſmalleſt mites, in their moſt inward receſſes. Wherefore we are wont to boyl for a long while, the matter to be diſſolved in water, or at leaſt to infuſe it in warm water, by which means, the more tenuious, and certain ſubtil Particles, which reſemble the nature of the Subject, are eaſily drawn forth, and impregnate the water, with the virtue of the whole mixture.</p>
                     <p>So much for the ſimple, or natural <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of water, to wit, for as much as its activity is wont ſomtimes to be promoted, by fire or aſcititious heat. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſo ſimple, but that it contains in it ſelf ſome Particles of another kind; as many be gathered from its eaſie Putrefaction; for oftentimes it is impregnated with Spirituous, Sulphureous, or Saline breathings, contracted from the Air or Earth, that for the drawing forth the tinctures of very many things, ſomtimes it excels an Artificial <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> for that Acidulous or Spawiſh waters, Mineral waters, Rain water, and <hi>May</hi> Dew, are of frequent uſe among Chymicks, for the remarkable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of diſſolving, with which they are ſtrong. Beſides, 'tis a vulgar obſervation, that ſome waters moſt eaſily diſſolvs Sope, and being throughly mixed with the ſame, cauſes in the liquor a great ſpume or froth; ſuch, if they be rubbed between the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, feel ſoft and gentle; but other waters, which being handled with the hands, are more harſh, refuſe the mixture both of Sope and Oyl, and ſo are accounted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable for the waſhing of Cloaths: theſe ſort of waters, if they ſhould be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a Glaſs, oftentimes affix a Cruſt to its bottom and ſides; becauſe they are impregnated, more than they ought, with Saline Particles, with which, when the Saline parts reſiding in the Sope combine, the Sulphureous are carried away, and they being excluded the pores, are thruſt forth as not miſcible, to the top of the Liquor. When Fleſh is boyled in theſe waters, it grows very red; which tincture indeed being thence contracted, is a ſign, that thoſe waters are ſomwhat imbued with Vitriol, or ſome other kind of Salt. But we will paſs to Artificial <hi>Menſtruas,</hi> in which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Liquor is furniſhed with Spirit, Salt, or Sulphur, being gathered apart, or many of them together.</p>
                     <p>The Spirituous <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of water is made, when from a Body ſwelling with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, a clear and limpid water is diſtilled; as from Wine, or ſtrong Beer, or other Bodies truly Fermented, and brought to exaltation: The kind of diſſolvent is hardly to be had ſo ſincere, but it is mixed with the Particles of more pure Sulphur, and ſomtimes of a volatile Salt. The former kind of Liquor is called Spirit of Wine, which being ſubtil, and very penetrating, eaſily enters the Bodies, and parts of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, and alſo of living Creatures, but hardly Minerals, or not at all: it extracts from many things, not any Particles, or reſembling the Nature of the whole mixture, (as common water) but chiefly Spirituous, and Sulphureous, the reſt being almoſt untouched; wherefore, it is wont to be uſed for the reſinous <hi>magiſteria</hi> of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, (which it draws fofth almoſt ſincere or without mixture, under the form of Cum or Reſine) in the mean time, it is not ſo fit as common water, for the extracts of Plants, which are not ſo indued with Sulphur: from Sulphureous things, as Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoin, Sulphur, Olibanum, Styrax, Amber, and the like, it draws forth excelent Tinctures: It diſſolves the fixed Salts of Herbs, alſo of Pearls and Coral, before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:107016:21"/>with Vinegar, by a long digeſtion, and receives their Tinctures into it ſelf: it leaves Sugar, and Gums, being diſſolvable in water, almoſt untouch'd. But there is another Spirituous <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> that is ſharpned with a volatile Salt, ſuch is the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor which is diſtilled out of blood, Harts-horn or Soot; it is far ſtronger than the former, and cuts moſt Bodies, except Metals, into parts, and oftimes deſtroys the forms of the whole mixture: yea it moſt excellently diſſolves ſecondarily, the moſt fixed Metal, to wit, Gold, being firſt reduced into a Calx, by its proper <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and reduces it into a Tincture, or potable Liquor.</p>
                     <p>They are accounted Sulphureous <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> which are brought forth of Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Bodies, under the form of an Oyl: theſe are prepared, either by diſtillation, ſuch as are chiefly the Oyl of Turpentine, Juniper, and the like; or by expreſſion, ſuch as are wrung forth of Olives, Almonds, and other Fruits, or Seeds of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Things diſtilled are of more efficacy, than preparations by expreſſion; either of them draw forth ſome Particles, from Vegetables, or Animals; by the vertues of which, theſe Oyls being impregnated, they are made fit for Medicinal uſe. Yea they are conveniently enough made uſe of, for the extracting of the Sulphureous Particles of Minerals, which ſomtimes they draw forth ſincere or unmixt: But if Oyl of Turpentine, or Lin-ſeed Oyl, draws forth by diſſolving, the combuſtible part of common Sulphur, in the mean time, the remaining Saline parts, and untouched by the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> grow into Cryſtals; as is obvious to every one, in the preparing the Balſam of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Mineral Bodies, in which the bond of Concretion chiefly depends upon Sulphur, as are the Fire-Stone, Antimony, common Brimſtone, and the like, are in ſome ſort diſſolved by a Sulphureous <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> which draws forth of the Body, Particles of the ſame kind, the Saline being almoſt untouched: wherefore Oyl of Turpentine, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> draw forth a Tincture from theſe; in the mean time, Saline <hi>Menſtrua</hi> ſuch as are diſtilled Vinegar, or Stygian waters, profit little for the diſſolving their Bodies: but that theſe, unleſs before Calcined, hardly are touched. But on the contrary, where the frame of the mixture conſiſts of a Saline bond, ſuch as are Iron, Copper and the lik, Saline <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> Spirit of Vitriol, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> receive in the diſſolving, the Particles of the ſame Nature into themſelves, the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous being almoſt untouched. This plainly appears, in the ſolutions of Metals, but chiefly and remarkably in Camphire, which Stygian waters reduce into a Liquor, in form of an Oyl, ſwimming on the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> to wit they diſſolve its frame, and receive ſome Saline parts, on which the Concretion depends, into themſelves; in the mean time the Sulphureous being untouched, they are gathered together apart, on the Superficies of the Liquor. There is ſomthing to be wondered at concerning Antimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: to wit, that its Concretion being very irregular, that Mineral becomes exceeding unlike, not only to other mixtures, but alſo to it ſelf; for it is very lax, nevertheleſs much compacted; it lies open to the leaſt injuries, yet is almoſt impervious to the greateſt, ſo that it may equally number its loſſes, with its Victories: ſome of its Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles lie ſo looſe, that they are brought away by any Oyly <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> or by a common <hi>lixivium</hi> or Lie: others in the mean while do ſo pertinaciouſly ſtick together, that <hi>Aqua Fortis</hi> cannot touch them, only <hi>Aqua Regia</hi> being poured upon it can know it; which ſo ſtrongly reſiſts it, that the fume raiſed up from thence, preſently obſcures the whole Room wherefore there ſeem to be in this, parts wholly of a different Nature, ſome imperfectly mixt, <hi>viz.</hi> Earthy and Sulphureous, which are eaſily looſned by a fit ſolvent; in the mean time others wholly Metallic, perfectly mixt, coming near in ſome ſort to the Nature of Gold it ſelf; which therefore are only to be diſſolved, by a fit <hi>Menſtruum</hi> of Salt.</p>
                     <p>The Saline <hi>Menſtrua</hi> are of divers kinds and natures, <hi>viz.</hi> of Vegetables, Animals, or Minerals. Among Vegetables are eminent, the ſowr juices of Fruits and Herbs, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Vinegars, acid Liquors diſtilled out of ponderous Woods, as Guaiacum, the Oak, and Box; in all which, the Saline Particles having gotten a Flux, either by Art or by Nature, give a notable ſowrneſs: or the Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum</hi> conſiſts of Salts of Tartar, or made by the cineration of Herbs, and diſſolved, which by the Fire are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much whetted, and acquire an acritude; in theſe the Saline Particles are fixed, and in a condition oppoſite to a Flux. To the rank of Animals I refer the Spirit of Urine, Harts-Horn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which although they are impregnated with Spirits, yet the take their chief forces from a Volatile Salt. But the ſtrongeſt Saline <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> are drawn forth of Minerals, ſuch are acetous Liquors, which are moſt ſtrongly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:107016:21"/>forced by fire, out of the Salts of Nitre, Sea-Salt, Alumn, Chalcarth or Vitriol, and ſuch like.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe which are drawn out of Vegetables, as Vinegars, and acid Liquors do beſt of all diſſolve Corals, Pearls, Shells, and Shelly ſubſtances: becauſe in theſe there is great plenty of Alcalizat Salt, with which the fluid Salt, which abounds in thoſe kind of acetous <hi>Menſtrua's,</hi> deſires to be moſt ſtrictly united; wherefore they being applyed to the body to be diſſolved, enter its pores and paſſages, looſen the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of the Particles of the Alcalizat Salt, and ſnatch them into their own Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace. Even after the ſame manner, the fluid Salt in a Vegetable <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches the Volatile Salt in the Horns of Animals.</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of <hi>Menſtrua's</hi> do corrode ſome Mettals towards the Superficies; but do not ſo potently unlock their bodies by diffolving, as Stygian waters, ſome Sulphureous ſubjects, being before looſened by Calcination, do enter aptly enough, and from thence carry forth Saline Particles. Wherefore, for the Salt of Tinn, Lead, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, Soot, and others, being firſt reduced into a <hi>Calx,</hi> we uſe diſtilled Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</p>
                     <p>The Salts of Tartar, and the fixed Salts of Herbs, although they ſerve for praecipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, rather than diſſolution, yet becauſe they conſiſt of ſharp, and very penetrating Particles, they are of egregious uſe: For watry <hi>Menſtrua's</hi> are chiefly ſharpned with theſe, for the extracting of the Tinctures of Vegetables. And altho bodies which abound with an alcalizat Salt, as Pearls, Coralls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are left wholly untouched by reaſon of the Homogeneity or agreeableneſs of the parts in either; and that alſo, they but little gnaw, only on the Superficies, being put upon Mettals, and grow together with their Salt, and Sulphur into ruſt; yet Sulphureous bodies they readily enter, ſo they be looſened by the fire, and unlock and pull aſſunder their joyntings or complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; wherefore, for the making of the Milk or <hi>Magiſterium</hi> of Sulphur, the Salt of Tartar moſt excellently conduces.</p>
                     <p>Saline <hi>Menſtrua's</hi> are moſt ſtrong, which are forced by diſtillation out of Minerals, to wit, out of Vitriol, Niter, Sea Salt, Alumn, Arſenick; Acetous Liquors are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled either from theſe ſingle, or from many of them mixed together; which as they are of the higheſt ſharpneſs, like to fire, readily enter moſt bodies, but chiefly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic bodies, and ſuch as conſiſt of a Saline bond, and diſſolve them eaſily into moſt ſmall parts. Theſe Liquors are only Saline Particles, which being driven by the force of heat, from the embrace of their Earth, having gotten by that means a Flux, are converted into water: as actual fire chiefly aſſaults Sulphureous bodies, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying the body draws to it ſelf the Conſimilary parts; Stygian waters (which are alſo called potential fire) eaſily pull aſſunder bodies, which very much abound with Salt, as Mettals; and break them, inviolable by fire, into moſt minute parts.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Solutions of Minerals, we may obſerve, that their frame is not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily deſtroyed, or looſened into parts, as other Concretes of Nature; but for this, moſt ſtong <hi>Menſtrua's,</hi> and thoſe chiefly Acetous, diſtilled from Salts, are required; the reaſon of which is, for that the Concretion of Minerals, depends moſtly upon great plenty of Salt, binding the reſt of the Particles, as with a bond; wherefore their ſubſtance is more ſolid, more hard, and compact, and only gives place to a Saline <hi>Menſtruum.</hi> When any Mineral, or Mettal is diſſolved, the fluid Particles of the Salt, in the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> moſt eaſily enter the moſt ſtrict Complications, of the fixed Salt in the mixture, and impervious to any other ſolvent, looſen them from their binding, and ſnatch them into their Embraces: after this manner, the Particles of the Salts being united, and dilated by the Liquor, are hidden in the pores and paſſages of the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> and together with theſe, ſtick, and are alſo ſupped up, by the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> the more pure and minutely divided bodies of Earth or Sulphur, which were in the mixture; in the mean time, the more thick, and more ſtufed with Earthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are praecipitated to the bottom of the diſſolving Liquor: wherefore Gold and Silver are wholly devoured by the <hi>Menſtruum;</hi> but Iron, Lead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and alſo Metallick recrements, ſend forth from themſelves, in the diſſolving, Heterogeneous Particles, as ſo many offſcourings: when Minerals are broke into parts by this means, the divided Particles, and moſt minutely broken, (ſo long as they equally cohaere with the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the fluid Salt, which are in the <hi>Menſtruum</hi>) being diſperſed through the Liquor of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and hidden in its pores and paſſages, are ſupped up, and rendred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. Yea alſo, the humor of the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> being taken away, the remaining
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:107016:22"/>
                        <hi>Calx,</hi> which conſiſts of the Particles of a mixt, and fluid Salt, combined together, is diſſolved in any other Liquor: but if after a Metallic ſolution, the fluid Salt be drawn off, from the Particles of the thing ſoluted, or by Calcination, it neither poyſes any Liquor it is put to, with a new adjection of fixed Salt, nor do the little bodies of the thing ſoluted fall through the pores of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> nor are they laſtly ſupped up, by any Liquor added to them.</p>
                     <p>But that among Metals, ſome are corraded by any acetous Liquor; in the mean time others, as Silver and Gold, require a peculiar ſolvent, as it were to be unlocked by an appropriat Key: and what is more wonderful, common <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> which eats Silver, leaves Gold altogether untouch'd: Gold, and has no power upon Silver: The reaſon of thoſe may be thus underſtood: Gold and Silver are more compact Metals, very much cleanſed from earthy matter; wherefore they are not broken into parts by any ſolvent, but only by thoſe kind of <hi>Menſtruas,</hi> which conſiſt of a Salt homogeneous or agreeable with them. But as the frame or ſubſtance of Silver depends upon a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triolic Salt, and that of Gold, on an Armoniac Salt (or of a more perfect kind, to wit, ſuch as is wont to be moſt ſtrictly complicated with Sulphur) hence <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſo long as it is ſtrong with a Vitriolic Virtue, combines with the Salt of the Silver, and therefore unlocks its frame or ſubſtance, but doth not looſen the concretion of Gold, which depends upon an Heterogeneous bond: If that to this <hi>Menſtruum, Sal Armoniac</hi> be added, the power of the Vitriolic Salt is blotted forth, and the Saline darts of the ſolvent are made fit only for the Gold, the Silver being untouched.</p>
                     <p>When Minerals are corroded by acetous <hi>Menſtrua's,</hi> we are not therefore to think, the ſame always to be reſolved into Elementary parts: that the Salt and Sulphur of them, may be had ſincere or unmixt, by this means (altho ſome boaſt, that they are eaſily able to ſhew ſuch Analyſes of Mettals) for that it appears to our obſervation, and frequent experience, that many of theſe are of ſo compact and ſolid a Concretion, that they cannot be broken, but into integral parts: as for example, Gold and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, after what manner almoſt ſoever handled, when they are reduced into mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Calxes, will at laſt by a ſtrong fire acquire their proper forms: <hi>viz.</hi> the Saline Particles of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> looſen the bond of Concretion, whereby the moſt minute integral parts of the mixture ſtick one to another; but the ſame ſolvent, is not able in all things, to break aſſunder the <hi>Copula</hi> of the firſt mixture, whereby the Elements are mutually bound together: ſo that for the moſt part Metallic Calxes, are only little bodies of the Concrete, broken into moſt ſmall little Globes, being involved by the Saline Particles of the <hi>Menſtruum:</hi> Wherefore, fire being applyed, thoſe corroſive Salts being pulled away from their Embrace, are wholly driven away; then the Metallic lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bits, or duſt, as ſo many little particular Globes being fuſed, by the intenſe heat, coming together into one Maſs by melting, reſume the Species of the Metall: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they who commonly affirm, that the Salts of Minerals for the moſt part, are only the Saline Particles of the ſolvent, conjoyned with the Metall, reduced as it were into fine flower, without doubt ſpeak truth in the preparations of Sol and Mercury, or of Gold and Quickſilver; alſo the Salt or Sugar of Saturn or Lead, is nothing elſe: But that ſweetneſs comes only from the Vinegar; for if in the diſtillation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> Vinegar, the joyning of the Veſſels are cloſed with Clay, and Salt, Chaulk and Horſe-Dung, on the Superficies of this, grows together a moſt white Salt, wonderfully ſweet, in every thing like to that Sugar: but from ſome, <hi>viz.</hi> from Iron, Copper, and Silver, are prepared fictitious Vitriols, which are for the moſt part Saline: For that the ſame, by diſtillation, amy be forced into acetous Liquors, as the Metallic recrements.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the ſolvence hitherto recited (which, by means of the Particles, which are ſtrong in them, act upon a peculiar and determinate matter) I know that Chymiſts do boaſt wonderful things, of a certain univerſal <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> by whoſe inſpiration every body what ever, may be eaſily reduced to its Principles, or firſt Elements: And tho <hi>Helmont</hi> have bragged, that he had attained to this Secret by his own Labour, and now dayly the Adepti of Chymiſtry, do aſpire to this end; yet the hopes and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of moſt, have failed them in this work, even as in the Philoſophers Stone. There are alſo ſome other famous <hi>Menſtrua's, viz.</hi> The <hi>Aqua vitae</hi> Tartariſated of <hi>Quer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citan,</hi> and his Philoſophic Vinegar, which are of noted uſe in the preparing of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines; but ſince I know nothing, or any ſtrange thing they have done, in the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bodies, we will paſs them over.</p>
                     <pb n="35" facs="tcp:107016:22"/>
                     <p>So much concerning ſolvent <hi>Menſtrua:</hi> about bodies to be diſſolved, a certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhould be inſtituted, whereby indeed their complections may more eaſily be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locked, and cut into moſt minute parts: Wherefore the Concrete is now pounded into powder, now cut into little bits, that the way might lye open for the ſolvent, to its moſt inward receſſes. If that the frame of the ſubject be harder, and more ſtrict, that it will not give place, but of a long time, to the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> before the diſſlolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is begun, there ought to be adminiſtred ſome aperitives, or openers, whereby the concretion may be firſt looſened, and ſomwhat opened: wherefore, the tincture of Steel, is more eaſily extracted, if its filings be ſprinkled with the juice of Limons, or the Spirit of Vitriol: in like manner Harts-Horn, or the ſhavings of Ivory are handled when we would have the decoctions of them quickly made: when formerly I have been very ſolicitous about this thing, <hi>viz.</hi> that I might render the more hard bodies eaſily ſoluble, in any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and that I had eſpecially tryed many things about Iron; after ſeveral experiments, at length by a certain chance, and almoſt thinking of ſomthing elſe, I found out a preparation, whereby without any Corroſive, or Acid Liquor, by the mediation only of a gentle heat, the body of Iron is opened, that being reduced into powder, gives immediately a tincture, to any Liquor, that neither Salts themſelves, are ſooner diſſolved in common water: By this means, I am wont to prepare ſuddenly, in great quantity, Mineral waters, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly reſemble our <hi>Tunbridg</hi> Spaws; and to render Wine, Beer, Milk, or Whey, with no trouble Chalybeated. By this means, Syrrops, Tinctures, Extracts, or <hi>Magiſteria</hi> our of Steel, are moſt eaſily to be had. Moreover, plainly by the ſame Artifice, Corals, Pearls, Eyes, and Claws of Crabs, and all ſhelly things, are prepared, that their powders preſently impart to any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> a tincture, or the virtues of the whole Concrete. And in this preparation, no ſtrange quality is introduced to the Subject, nor its own proper quality loſt.</p>
                     <p>When I had by this means, learnt to unlock all Bodies whatſoever, conſiſting of a Saline bond, preſently from the Analogy of this, was made known the means of unlocking Subjects, whoſe Concretion is wholly Sulphureous: for I am wont ſo to prepare common Sulphur, that its powder immediatly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates any Liquor, with the tincture and virtue of Sulphur. The Spirit of Wine, ſuddenly contracts a deep colour, and very red, that being put into it. Common water by the infuſion, or decoction of the ſame Powder, is rendered clearly Sulphureous, and gilds Silver, and by this means, from that Tincture, a praecipitation being made of White Wine, or Vinegar, the Milk of Sulphur is eaſily prepared, in great quantity. Out of Sulphurated Wine by this infuſion, I make a Syrrop, than which there is ſcarce found a more excellent remedy, in the diſtempers of the Thorax. By this means, Tinctures, Extracts, Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtries, are prepared from Sulphur, with no labour, and without any ſmatch of the fire. By the ſame way preparations from Amber, Benzoin, and other Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous things, eaſily diſſolvable in any <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are compoſed. But enough and too much of this: we will now paſs to the other great diſſolvent of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Nature of Fire: and by the way of Heat, and Light.</head>
                     <p>WE may almoſt pronounce the ſame thing of Fire, what the Philoſophers of old did of the firſt Matter, to wit, that it was potentially every where, and in all things; but in none, in act. For among theſe ſublunaries, Fire hath got no exiſtence of its own Nature, or certain means of duration: It is produced almoſt in every Subject, but is retained long in none, but it ſuddenly vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, and expires: yea unleſs ſome external accidents, oftentimes ſhould concur for its production, I think it had not at all been in the world. Some have dreamed, that its Sphear is ſcituate under the Moon: but this was introduced only, for the making the Hypotheſis of the four Elements: for ſuch a thing ſeems conſonant neither to Senſe, nor Reaſon. That we may rightly ſearch out the Nature of Fire, we muſt ſeek in what Bodies it is chiefly to be found, and how they are diſpoſed; and then we may proceed to the unfolding its eſſence.</p>
                     <p>The Subjects moſt convenient both for the producing, and the maintaining of Fire, are of that kind, in which there are very many Particles of Sulphur, and but only a moderate portion of Water, Salt, and Earth: for theſe do hinder its inkindlings, and being plentifully poured on it, extinguiſh it being inkindled: Wherefore Bituminous, Fat, and Oyly things, quickly take flame: ſo alſo Chips, Straw, light and dry Wood: in the mean time, Metals, Minerals, the glebe of the Earth, Dung, wet Straw, and green Wood, are hardly, or not at all to beinkindled.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we obſerve, that all the time Fire continues in the Subject, Sulphureous Particles fly away in heaps, and from the departure of theſe, the ſubſtance of the burning body is by degrees deſtroyed; in the mean time, very much of Salt and Earth, remains in the form of Aſhes, after the burning.</p>
                     <p>There is a third obſervation, that when the Sulphureous Particles are wholly, or for the moſt part flown out of any Subject, the burning wholly ceaſes, and the form of fire is quite deſtroyed; nor can it be renewed in the remaining matter, wanting of Sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, we will note, that ſomtimes ſome Bodies conceive a burning with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advention of another fire, only by their own effervency, and by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine motion of the implanted Particles, and of their own accord are reduced into Aſhes; as when wet Hay is layd up cloſe, it firſt grows hot, then afterwards breaks forth into ſmoke and flame; or the Wheels and Axeltrees of Carts or Wains, being heated by too great agitation, are inkindled.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions, we may affirm, that the form of fire, wholly depends upon Sulphureous Particles, heaped up in any Subject, and breaking forth from it in heaps: and that fire is no other thing, than the motion and eruption, of theſe kind of Particles, impetuouſly ſtirred up. For Sulphur is of an exceeding fierce and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamed Nature, whoſe little bodies, when (the yoak of the mixture being ſhook off) they begin to be thickly heaped together, diffuſe themſelves on every ſide like a torrent, break whatſoever obſtacles are in the Subject, deſtroy whatever comes in oppoſition, or fling it down headlong. Nor do the only unlock their proper Subjects, but alſo lay open the gates and doors of any other Subject near, that they can reach to, and there incite to the like fury, all the conſimilary Particles of Sulphur, and provoke them to an eruption: wherefore fire every where inkindles fire.</p>
                     <p>The Sulphureous Particles, while they, heaped together within the confines of their Subject, or on its Superficies, are agitated with a rapid motion, but are detained by the Embrace of other little Bodies, from a more free eruption, and more aggregated, conſtitute the form of fire; as is to be ſeen in burning Coals, or in glowing Iron; but when theſe ſort of Particles fly away by heaps, from the ſame Subject, and bound together, they produce flame, which is only an heap, or rather a torrent, of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Sulphur flowing together, and conjunctly flying away: if Watery, Earthy,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:107016:23"/>and Saline Particles, are commixt with the Sulphureous breaking away, and are able to disjoyn and ſeparate them, only ſmoke is excited; which afterwards, the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous little Bodies more plentifully breathing forth themſelves, and getting together, breaks forth into flame.</p>
                     <p>The inkindling of Fire happens very many ways. The firſt and moſt ſimple is, when from hard bodies ſtruck one againſt another, but ofteneſt from a Flint ſtruck againſt Steel, ſparks of fire break forth; which being received in Tinder, made of a Linnen Cloth burnt to blackneſs, dilate themſelves, and then a Match or Sulphurated thing being applyed, they cauſe the inkindling of a flame. Secondly, a fire often happens in dry Wood, and dry things, when by the too great attrition of the parts, and agaitation, being made hot, they conceive an inkindling of their own accord. And thirdly, when Bodies abounding with Sulphur, as Hay, or Flax laid up wet, (of which mention was before made) grow hot of their own accord, and afterwards are inkindled. The fourth way, is the moſt uſual, of introducing fire into any Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that it may be inkindled by another fire. We will a little more conſider the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral proceſſes of theſe.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Hard Bodies ſtruck one againſt another, ſhake forth little ſparks of fire: as a Flint with Iron, or with a Flint; <hi>Indian</hi> Canes, the Fire Stone, and many other things. The reaſon of this is, becauſe the Particles of Sulphur, which reſide in the Superficies of a hard Body, if they are ſmitten by another hard Body, are not able to go back inward, (becauſe in hard things there is not afforded any ceſſion of the parts, from place to place) nor can the ſmitten Particles of Sulphur evaporate by degrees; but that by reaſon of the vehemency of the ſtroke, they are neceſſitated to break forth in heaps: Wherefore, when by this means, many of them are moved together, and are aggregated, they exhibit the apparition of fire, The ſparks being received into the half-burnt Linnen or Tinder, are dilated into a greater fire, for that the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles, in ſuch a Subject are eminent, and are brought as it were to the very top it ſelf of eruption or breaking forth, wherefore by the leaſt ſpark being moved or ſtirred up, a way being made they fly away.</p>
                     <p>The very ſame reaſon is for Wood being made hot, and afterwards fired, by too great attrition; by which means, the Axeltrees and Wheels of Chariots, or of Mills, are frequently fired: for the Sulphureous Particles, being by this means very much moved, are more thickly heaped together; and when, having as it were made an Army, they are able to remove, or ſtrike away the reſt, they preſently break forth in Troops, and by their going away cauſe a burning.</p>
                     <p>In Hay or Dung laid up wet, the Particles of Sulphur very much abound; which having gotten the watery Latex for a Vehicle, run themſelves into motion: but when for want of Ventilation, they cannot by little and little exhale, being ſtraitned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and ſo brought into their exaltation, they are able to joyn more one to another, and mutually to incite themſelves: then afterwards, being very much heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they unfold themſelves more largely, and begin to break the Dens of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and ſo produce a burning. For it is to be obſerved in any Subject, when the Particles of Sulphur, being more ſlowly moved, fly away by degrees, neither heat, nor fire, but only a dryneſs, and leanneſs, ſucceed. But if they are more rapidly moved, than that they may be able to exhale leiſurely, a heat is ſtirred up in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: then if yet they are agitated more vehemently, and impetuouſly, and being more thickly agglomerated or heaped together, they break forth in heaps, a deflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or flame follows the heat.</p>
                     <p>Fire being inkindled in any Subject, enters and inkindles, whatever Sulphureous thing is next it. For as Saline <hi>Menſtrua, viz.</hi> Stygian waters, aſſault Metals, ſtuffed with Mineral Salt, and looſen their Saline Particles, as being of kin, from the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo alſo the Sulphureous Particles, being inkindled, break whatever Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Particles are next them, and ſtir them up into the like motion of burning, with themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the nature and production of Fire: it remains that we next inquire into the effects of Fire, and alſo concerning its virtue and efficacy; to wit, what kind of Bodies it diſſolves, and by what means; and alſo for what uſes it ſerves for. The chief effects of Fire are Heat and Light; either of them are excited by emanations, or <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſent from an inkindled Body; but after a far different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for truly, heat is moſt often produced at a diſtance, without light; alſo light, without any ſenſible heat.</p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:107016:24"/>
                     <p>Heat, foraſmuch as it belongs to the ſenſe of the touch, is conceived, when a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſion is induced in the skin, or any other Organ of the touch, whereby the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Fibres and Nervous parts are drawn aſunder, moved into light Spaſms or Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and ſomtimes (if the ſtroke be vehement) ſuffer a ſolution of the union. This is wont to be done, either by the bringing near of Fire, or of another Body made hot by Fire, or by ſome other means. For from either, the Sulphureous or warming Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles being excited, into a more rapid motion, and breaking forth by heaps ſpread abroad, which, as ſo many little darts, being thruſt into our skin, or other Senſory of the touch, either by tickling gently, they bring to it a pleaſing ſenſe of heat; or by ſtriking it more grievouſly, the troubleſom ſenſe of burning or ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>For the effect of heat, Fire is applyed to Bodies, eith immediatly, and ſo either for the ſake of Burning, Roſting or Boyling; or mediatly, <hi>viz.</hi> by the interjection of another Body. Bituminous things, Coals, and other things dug out of the Earth, alſo Vegetables and chiefly their Leaves, and Woods, are burnt, for heat, neceſſary for human uſes, and for the producing, and conſerving it. Stones are burnt for Lime; Vegetables for the preparing of Salts. The fleſh of Animals is wont to be Roſted, and the Fruits of Vegetables; whereby they may become better food for men. For by Roaſting, the ſuperfluous humidity is evaporated, and the Sulphureous parts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtirred by the neighbouring heat, are placed in their vigor and exaltation, by which means, they afford a more grateful food to the Palat, and of better digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Stomach. By fire Metals are fuſed or melted, and moſt Minerals, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are either very much purified, or they are better formed into various fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guresby Smiths. Metals, and very many Minerals, alſo Salts, although they are not inflamed, and take a firing (becauſe they abound with leſs Sulphur, than Salt) yet by a violent fire, they glow, and ſuffer a fuſion; for that the Sulphureous Particles of the Fire, enter the Saline little Bodies, tho moſt compact, and diſſociate them for the time; which however pulled one from another, preſently the fire being exhaled, come again together, and are ſtrictly united.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, when fire is mediatly adminiſtred, the Particles of the ſoluted Sulphur, and heaped together into fire, are diſſociated, as when a cloud is diſperſed into moſt little drops of Rain: wherefore they lay aſide the form of fire; but tho diſperſed, they eaſily paſs through any impediment, and induce a ſufficient ſtrong heat to every Subject. By this means, fire is accommodated to very many uſes, the chief of which, and the more accuſtomed, are, elixation or boyling, digeſtion, and diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
                     <p>In Boyling, the Particles of heat do paſs into a watery <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and being united with its Particles, inſinuate themſelves deeply into the thing to be boyled: whoſe ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous humidities they carry away, digeſt the crudities, and carry them into a ſtate of maturity. Boyling is inſtituted, either that the Liquor might be impregnated with the ſtrength of the thing to be Boyled, or that the thing to be Boyled might be made tender, by the Liquor entring into it, and its Particles exalted: for Meats and all Eatable things, are rendered more grateful to the Palate by Boyling, even as well as by Roſting.</p>
                     <p>Digeſtion is very much uſed in Medicines, that their more ſlow Particles, may be carried to a greater activity; and ſomtimes, that they being too fierce might be fixed, and rendred more mild.</p>
                     <p>The moſt noble uſe of heat, or of mediat fire, is had in diſtillations; for the Particles of heat, do pull away ſome Particles of the Subject from others, (as it were by a Spagyric Anatomy) they reſolve all Bodies, into their parts and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But the conſideration of this thing, is too laborious and hard, to be inſerted into this Tract.</p>
                     <p>As heat reſpects the Senſory of the Touch, ſo Light that of the Sight, and affects it ſo after a proper and peculiar manner, that nothing at all is diſcerned, beſides the rays of light, direct, or reflected: for the various appearances of Colours, and the divers proportions of Bodies, and whatſoever we ſee with our Eyes, is only light; to wit, either proceeding directly, or ſtrait from a lucid Body, or retorted from another Body, to the Eye, and ſo formed into various figures and colours. The conſideration of Light, contains in it ſelf, very many ſtupendious things, and is of deep ſpeculation; which are not however proper for this place: It will ſuffice to take notice here, of a ſew things, concerning its Original, Motion, and Perceptibility.</p>
                     <pb n="39" facs="tcp:107016:24"/>
                     <p>Light is wont to be diſtinguiſhed, either that it is Etherial, which flows from the Sun and Stars; or Elementary, which only proceeds from a fired Body, enkindled into a flame. It ſeems, that either is only flame enkindled in a greater dimenſion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into a moſt thin compoſition: for it appears to the ſenſe, that from Sulphureous things being inflamed, (as for example) from a burning Candle, moſt thin <hi>Effluvia's.</hi> or moſt ſmall divided little Bodies perpetually do ſpring; which being diffuſed into an Orb, and ſtretched forth into right Lines, as it were from the Centre to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference, are ſtill expanded on every ſide, in a great heap, and fill all the ſpace within the Sphear of its activity, with a luminous ray. The Particles of the flame, which firſt fall away or depart from a lucid Body, are ſtill driven forward by thoſe following behind; and ſo theſe alſo by others; and ſo by a continued Series of Particles of the flames ſtill ſucceeding, the beams of light are formed, and are thickly or cloſly dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted into all parts.</p>
                     <p>The motion of theſe is exceeding ſwift; like ſtreams of water, breaking forth with a force, they paſs through the medium in the twinckling of a Eye, and, as thoſe wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, if the motion be cut off near the Spring, moſt ſwiftly vaniſh. When the Rays of light come directly from a Luminous Body, they conſtitute a medium, only clear or lucid, without the appearance of any colour or image: when the ſame Rays meet with a ſolid Body, they do not paſs rightly through it, but being either broken off, they are drowned or loſt, or elſe they are reflected and leap back or rebound, as when a Ball being caſt againſt a Wall, with a continued motion is ſtruck back, upon other parts, according to the Angles of what ſtopped it. The Rays of light, reflected from other Bodies, being fallen into the Eye, repreſent the Images of viſible things, and the varieties of colours. For as the ſuperficies of viſible Bodies are rough, and indued with little pores, and innumerable eminences, or riſings up, hence the Rays of light, being moſt thickly impacted in them, and reflected from every part, according to all the ways of inclinations, and directions, as for as they go, do meet together round about, into very many tops of Cones, in which the beams proceeding from the whole object, as from a baſe, repreſent the image or ſimilitude of the whole; and in theſe kind of images, the medium is every where planted, that wherever the Eye is placed, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the image of the ſame thing, though not wholly after the ſame manner. But foraſmuch, as the beams of the ſame light, being impacted in every Body, and vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly refracted and diſtorted, about its rough and unequal ſuperficies, from thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected as it were with turnings and windings into the Eye, they cauſe the diverſe Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena or appearances of colours, to appear. For colous, and images of things, do not exiſt in their own nature, but as it were ſpectrums, only from another place, change their apparitions by the Rays of light. When dark night brings thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this inferior world, things are not perceived but by the Touch, and loſe all their appearances: when the Sun reviſits the Hemiſphere, he brings forth a new Creation of things; and the whole Atmoſphere is filled at once, with a ſudden and manifold progeny, to wit, with infinite images of Bodies, and appearances of colours.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Light does not only illuſtrate the medium, that ſight may be made, as ſome would have it; but it alſo creates the very objects of ſight, and introduces them into the Penetralia or inward parts of the Eye, yea to the moſt inward receſſes of the Brain. This doth the ſame Office for the Eye, as the Intellect doth for the Soul, to wit, it forms the Ideas or Images of Bodies, and renders them perceptible by the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive faculty. Light only is able to penetrate the Coats and Humors of the Eye, to move the little Fibres of the Optic Nerve, and to ſtir them up into an act of ſenfati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Becauſe the Images of things, being forged by the Rays of light, variouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected, and meeting together on the tops of the Cones, are ſtayed within the Pupil, or dark ſpot of the Eye; they ſeem as objects in a cloſe Chamber, admitted by a ſmall hole, to be repreſented to the lefe: and the Concave or Convex Glaſſes, whereby the parallel beams are broken, or the inverſe reduced or brought back, do egregiouſly ſupply the humors placed in the Eye, beyond the induſtry of human Art; by the help of which, the image of every object is painted, near the thin skin of the Eye, in its juſt figure and proportion: and then, from the motion, which this Image impreſſes on the little Fibres of the Optick Nerve, the act of ſight is performed in the Brain. Thus much for Heat and Light, the Speculation of which, tho it may ſeem to be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether beſides the Doctrine of Fermentation, yet foraſmuch as by the motion of theſe kind of Sulphureous Particles, many other Phyſical Operations alſo performed, a
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:107016:25"/>brief mention of them ought not to have been overpaſs'd in this place. But before we ſhall lay aſide quite the conſideration of Fire, it will be here worth our while to inquire concerning ſome Subjects, as it were irregular, to wit, in which fire ſhews ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable virtues, and beyond its common manner: of this ſort, are among Simples common Sulphur, and <hi>Sal Nitre;</hi> among Compounds, Gun-Powder, and <hi>Aurum Fulminans.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning common Sulphur we may obſerve, that it quickly catches fire, heat it immediatly breaks forth into flame ſuch (as nothing beſides) that by its deflagration it puts out the Kitchen fire, that it ſends forth a blueiſh flame, and whitens all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with its Smoke or Soot. If you behold the matter of this Subject, or the parts of which the mixture is compoſed, its Spagyrical Analyſis will exhibit, great plenty of pure Sulphur, a moderate quantity of Vitriolic Salt, a little of Spirit, Water and Earth. For when common Sulphur is diſſolved, by the Spirit of Turpentine, the Sulphureous part impregnates the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with a very deep Tincture, and the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line grows into Cryſtals: or when it is fired under a Bell, the Sulphur wholly burns, in the mean time the Salt being reſolved, and having taken a Flux, is fixed about the ſides of the Veſſel, and ſo exhibits a Liquor, moſt like the Spirit of Vitriol, or rather the very ſame. To which add, if you mingle the Oyl of Vitriol, and Antimony to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and diſtill it in a Retort, a Yellow Sulphur, juſt like the common, will be Sublimed in the neck of the Retort.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, becauſe there are very many Particles of Sulphur in this Concrete, and that they lie looſe and unbound in the mixture, (to wit, neither divided and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by the coming between of Earth, or Water, nor much bound together by Salt) therefore they are of a moſt prompt motion: wherefore by the leaſt ſpark of fire, they break forth from the looſe frame; and becauſe very many run forth adoors toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, therefore not a naked fire, as in every Combuſtible thing beſides, but firſt of all and immediatly a flame is inkindled. Its flame becomes blueiſh, becauſe 'tis almoſt pure Sulphur that burns, not mixed with the Particles of Water and Earth, as it is in Wood or Straw. The very ſame thing happens to Spirit of Wine being inflamed. It extinguiſhes the Kitchen fire by reaſon of the little Bodies of Vitriolic Salt left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and the ſame being eventilated with the flame and fume of Sulphur, gives a white colour to things; the like to which, the <hi>Effluvia's,</hi> exhaled from the Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian Waters, do effect.</p>
                     <p>Concerning <hi>Sal Nitre,</hi> we will take notice, that it is not to be inkindled at all by it ſelf; but to be melted by an intenſe fire: but being mixed with any Sulphureous things, it breaks forth into a flame, with a certain force and exploſion: For being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to common Sulphur, Antimony, or Tartar, it burns with a thundering noiſe; alſo if you put into melted Nitre, a burning Cole, or Wood, the flame is exploded round about, with a wind, ſo that the matter put in is flung up and down here and there, and often times flung clear out of the Veſſel: by this kind of deflagration, what is Nitrous is conſumed, the fixed Salt (which is Tartar) remains. When Nitre is diſtilled, Sand or Brick duſt, is mixt with it in a double quantity at leaſt; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Nitre melting is not at all looſened into a vapor. In the diſtilling the vapor ſent forth is very red; ſo that the Receptacle ſhines with a ſplendor, as if a flame were ſhut up within it: a ſharp corroſive Liquor is ſtilled forth, which diſſolves moſt Metals; alſo Gold.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being truly weighed, it ſeems that this mixture conſiſts chiefly of aboundance of Salt, and a little Sulphur, but theſe not fixed and idle, but either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and ready for motion, and not without a certain reſiſtance bound together: to wit, the Sulphureous little Bodies, being rouled about by the Saline, and as it were ſtrictly preſſed, ſtill endeavour to get forth; but being ſtrictly bound within, they are not able to riſe forth by their own ſtrength, or endeavour: but as ſoon as, by the mixture and inkindling of another Sulphureous Body, the Particles of the Salt are disjoyned, and their Priſons unlocked, preſently the included little Bodies of Sulphur, as it were breaking Priſon, fling themſelves forth with violence, remove every Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſtrike the Air violently with a ſudden eruption.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon why fire doth not inkindle Nitre, being incloſed in a Veſſel, but only melts it, when in the mean time, any Sulphureous matter being fired, makes it to flame forth with a noiſe, is, becauſe the little Bodies, which fall away from the fire, enter the Nitre, make it a little looſe, and diſſociate the concretion of the Salt, but not ſo looſen it, that a way may be made for the included Sulphur: but by the addition
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:107016:25"/>of Sulphureous things, the Saline compaction is more diſſolved, and is ſo far unlocked, that the Particles of the incloſed Sulphur fly away all together, and being freed from their ſtraightneſs, do hugely ſtretch themſelves abroad, and ſeek greedily an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe ſpace.</p>
                     <p>That there is plenty of Sulphur in Nitre, beſides its deflagration, the Geneſis of it ſufficiently teſtifies; for it is beget chiefly in places, where the Sulphureous Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Animals abound. The uſe of it in agriculture argues the ſame thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fertility of the Earth depends very much upon it: And to this alſo, the flaming colour, ſhining in the diſtilling may perſuade.</p>
                     <p>From theſe premiſes, it will not be difficult, to unfold the nature of Gun-Powder, uſed in Warlike Inſtruments. For the ſudden firing, and vehement exploſion of it ariſe, for that thoſe very many, and almoſt infinite Particles of Sulphur, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute that fire-dilating Body, being fired, fly away together in a moment; all which breaking forth at once, a force being made, and deſiring a moſt free and ample ſpace, for their expanſion, violently move the Air, and all obſtacles, and ſo are exploded or thruſt forth with a noiſe. There is in this mixture, common Sulphur put, becauſe its Particles are looſe, and ready for motion, and therefore apt to move a quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindling: there is added Charcoal duſt, becauſe in that alſo, the little Sulphureous Bodies (as is ſeen in Tinder, that is made of half burnt Linnen) are brought to the very top of eruption; and therefore theſe preſently conceive an inkindling, and both theſe being fired, and oppoſed to the Nitre, they quickly looſen its frame, and ſend forth the Sulphureous Particles incloſed in it; which indeed break forth from their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediments with a force, and as the blaſt of a Bellows, encreaſe the ſtrength of the whole in firing. The Charcoal duſt is added in a moderate quantity; though it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Terreſtrial matter, yet by reaſon of the Sulphur being carries forth in it, it accelerates the deflagration of this mixture: For the Coal and Nitre being beaten together, is ſooner fired, and with a greater exploſion, than Nitre and Sulphur: But if the Coals be added to this Compoſition, (as they are wont to make it for Cannon and great Guns) in a greater quantity than it ought, and improportionate to the Nitre, the immediat firing is ſomwhat retarded, by reaſon of the interjection of the Earthy matter; and it happens, that the Sulphureous little Bodies therein, apt to be too haſtily inkindled, are a little disjoyned, and ſo the ſubſtance of the infuſed powder, takes fire ſucceſſively, and by parts, and not all at once.</p>
                     <p>The reaſon of <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> does not ſo manifeſtly appear: but it ſeems won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, that the Calx of a Metal, otherways inviolable by fire, ſhould be brough into a powder, one grane of which, if it be but lightly heated by fire, is exploded with ſo great a force, and yields ſuch a noiſe, that is an hundred fold beyond Gun-powder. I know many deduce the cauſe of this, as in Gun-powder, from a Nitrous-Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mixture: For they ſuppoſe the Nitre drawn forth from the ſolvent <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> to joyn together with the Sulphur of thE Metal, and ſo the powder from thence prepared, to get that fulminating force. But in truth, if this matter be better thought on, it will appear far otherways; becauſe this golden thundring powder, is not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, as preparations of Nitre with Sulphur: for if fire be put to it, it goes off only ſucceſſively, by grains, nor as in Gun-powder, doth the whole fulminate at once; but being put into an Iron, Silver, or other convenient Veſſel, and for ſome time heated, by a ſudden fire, at length all the Particles being ſtirred together into motion, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded with a mightly noiſe; but yet being exploſed, it yields neither flame nor ſparks neither is the Gold loſt. For if this powder fulminates in an open Veſſel; whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is of the Gold, remains after the thundering, in the form of a purple powder; and may be gathered up. That the genuine cauſe of this may be extricated, there are ſome things to be obſerved, concerning its preparations, which will give no ſmall light.</p>
                     <p>For the making of this powder, it is altogether requiſite, that a ſolution of Gold be made with a <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> impregnated with Sal Armoniack, or at leaſt Analogical to it: for I have tryed it in vain with the Spirit of Nitre, Salt, with the Bezoartic Spirit, and ſome others. Then next it is requiſite, that the Calx be precipitated with Oyl of Tartar; for if the ſame be brought into a powder, with Silver or Mercury being caſt in, it loſes its thundring force. Alſo, if the Liquor of the Tartar, be too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately poured in, that with the great heat, a repercuſſion of the thing ſoluted be made, it often loſes its fulminating virtue: but a precipitation being leiſurely made, the powder ſetling in the bottom is waſhed away, by the often pouring on of warm water, which, though it be moſt often waſhed and dryed, far exceeds the weight of the diſſolved Gold.</p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:107016:26"/>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions, in ſeems moſt likely, that whilſt the Gold is diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by an appropriate <hi>Menſtruum</hi> for this buſineſs, ſome little Bodies of <hi>Sal Armoniack,</hi> (or ſome other reſembling it) being greatly akin to the Gold, do moſt ſtrictly co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here with its Particles; which then by the Salt of Tartar leiſurely in the precipitating infuſed, are more fixed, and more ſtrictly tyed faſt together: and then the exploſion of this powder, or Solary Calx, is nothing elſe than a violent eruption of thoſe kind of Salts, from the Coheſion or Embrace of the Gold. For when the powder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared after this manner; is brought to the fire, or is otherways made hot: the heat cauſes the <hi>Sal-Armoniack</hi> Particles, or others of the ſame nature affixed to the Solar, to diſſociate; which notwithſtanding, (when they hardly depart one from another) are not pulled aſunder, but by a ſtrong and continued heat: yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being pulled aſunder with a certain force, by reaſon of the ſudden and violent breaking off, they ſtrike the Air impetuouſly, and ſo cauſe a moſt ſtrong noiſe, for their bulk. But in the mean time, if the exploſion be made under a Silver Spoon, you will ſee a ſeparation made of either Particles, here the Solar of a Purple colour, there the Saline of an Aſh colour. But that this powder doth not make a noiſe, unleſs it be leiſurely precipitated with the Oyl of Tartar, it is becauſe ſome Particles of the Salt of Tartar, being before bound together with the <hi>Sal-Armoniac</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, do couple together, by which means all are more ſtrongly combined: For the Salt of Tartar being pounded with the mixture of Nitre and Sulphur fixes their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles for a time; that this Compoſition is not preſently inkindled by heat; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards is exploded with a ſtrong noiſe. And powder prepared after this manner ſeems to imitate the Nature of <hi>Aurum Fulminans:</hi> and it is probable that from other Minerals diſſolved and precipitated by reaſon of the ſtrict Coheſions of the Salt with the Metal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic matter, and their violent abruptions, thundering Calxes may be prepared. That truly the preparation of this chiefly depends on the Combination of the Salts, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, becauſe, if in the Precipitating (as I have known it ſomtimes to have hapned) the Oyl of Tartar, being too haſtily infuſed, the Complexion of the Salts is diſſolved with the Metallic matter, the powder falls in ſmall quantity to the bottom, and of a very Purple colour, whoſe grains are fragments of almoſt moſt pure Gold, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not fulminate at all: afterwards in that precipitated Liquor, very many ſlender Cryſtals grow together, which are indeed the Salts, having ſuffered a Divorce from the Metal. Beſides, That the Salt of Tartar, trings ſomthing to the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this powder, it is a ſign, becauſe thoſe things which take away the fulminating force from this, are of the ſame Nature, which chiefly work upon the Salt of Tartar; as a beating it together with common Sulphur, Spirit of Salt, Oyl of Vitriol, or of Sulphur: for theſe grow hot, and greedily deſire to be joyned with the Salt of Tartar, and ſo they call it away from the Embraces of the Gold; by which means the Combination of the Salts, with the Particles of the Gold, is looſned, and therefore loſes its Gun-like force. What is commonly ſaid, that this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will be preſently inkindled, or exploded, by a moſt light heat, or by ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in an Iron Ladle, is nothing true, as appears to me, for I have often tryed it. Nor is it more worthy of belief, what is ſaid, that this only forces downwards, and breaks the thickeſt hollow Pipes with its force; in the mean time, that it doth not move or ſhake any thing laid over it, becauſe long ſince I made tryal after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; two grains of this being laid in a Silver Spoon, I covered with a Doller, then a Candle being held under the Spoon, upon the exploſion of the powder, there follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a great noiſe, and there was a little hollow made in the bottom of the Spoon, almoſt through, and the piece of mony was carried up with a force to the Cieling, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, when this <hi>Aurum Fulminans</hi> is exploſed, its force is diffuſed round.</p>
                     <p>Altho vehement heat, and incited, and alſo the emiſſion of Smoke and Soot, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends for the moſt part upon fire; yet ſomtimes we perceive it to be produced in ſome ſubjects, and that in a very high degree, without its being actually inkindled. A moſt known inſtance of which thing is, quick Lime ſprinkled with water: which alſo Sty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian waters ſhew, being mingled with Iron, the Butter of Antimony, and with the Salts of the ſtagma of Vegetables. The learned men, <hi>Gunter, Conringius, Hogelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> and almoſt all that have touched on the Doctrine of Fermentation, have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the effects of this Nature, as eſpecial examples of Fermentations, wherefore it will be worth our labour, to inquire ſomthing concerning each of them: but on this condition (which I alſo have obſerved in other diſquiſitions) that I willingly let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone the opinion of others; for a Traveller had rather drink at the Fountains
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:107016:26"/>themſelves: I will then as briefly and ſuccinctly as I can diſpatch the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>Quick-Lime is made of the Lime Stone, alſo of many others (excepting only ſuch which conſiſt of a reddiſh and as it were ſandy grain) being Calcined in a cloſe Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, for many days, with a reverberating fire: by this means, the frame of the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is looſned, that it goes into a friable matter, or that may be crumbled, which by reaſon of the high aſtriction or binding Nature, in which it excels, ſerves moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently for the making of Cements for Walls: This Calx or Lime being taken from the Furnace, reteins ſtill the form of Stone, and ſeems cold to the touch, but water being poured thereon, it ſwells up, and grows wonderfully hot, ſending forth ſmoak, that it burns all Bodies that are put into it, beſides it falls of it ſelf into a white duſt: To which Particles this motion and heat ought to be aſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> whether to thoſe implanted in the Lime ſtone, or to the others acquired by the fire, doth not eaſily appear: but that we may looſe this knot, if we can, I have inſtituted this Analyſis of quick Lime. I put about half a pound of it into a large Cucurbit, then water being poured thereon, I fitted the little Head with a capacious Receiver, by and by, within five mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of an hour, the matter began to ſwell, and to grow very hot; then a ſmoak, and a breath being raiſed, all the Veſſels became ſo hot, that I could ſcarce touch them with my hands. A clear water Diſtilled forth into the Receiver, about ſix Ounces, which was not ſharp, but of a Styptic or Aſtringent ſweetiſh taſt; the remaining powder in the Cucurbit, I boiled with common water, and the Lye thereof made, I endeavoured to boil away with a gentle Fire; while it did evaporate, there ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together on the Superfices of the Liquor, a white and cruſty little skin, alſo of a ſweetiſh taſt, and the ſame being taken away, preſently a new one ſucceeded; the humor being at laſt wholly exhaled, there remained in the bottom nothing that was ſharp or ſalt.</p>
                     <p>We may Collect from this, that this heat doth not proceed from the implanted Principles of the Lime ſtone, <hi>viz.</hi> either Saline or Sulphureous however moved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves: for only a ſweetiſh Salt was to be found in it, which was alſo Volatile; and it is a ſign that there is not much Sulphur in the Limeſtone, becauſe by a long Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination, the form of the mixture is not quite deſtroyed, nor its ſubſtance wholly broken: wherefore, it is very likely, that whilſt theſe ſtones are burnt in the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, ſome Particles of Fire do ſtrictly cleave to the Saline, and ſo reſide in that mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as it were ſtrangers; which whilſt they lie a ſleep, and continue idle, and being ſeparated one from another, by the coming between of Earth, although they are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many, do not raiſe up heat; For all heat depends upon motion: but when water is poured to it, thoſe fiery Particles, being thruſt out of their Cells, flow together, and fly aways by heaps from that Inn; ſo breaking forth by Troops, they cauſe a very intenſe heat, and becauſe diluted with water, only a ſmoak, and not an actual Fire.</p>
                     <p>It is a ſign that little Bodies of fire, or fiery Particles, do ſtick a long while in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Calcined, becauſe Iron Inſtruments, according as thoſe Particles are driven forth of their pores, more or leſs, leiſurely or by heaps, become ſoft or hard; tough or brittle: morover it is obſerved, that bricks or freſh Earthen Veſſels being dipped in water, cauſe a certain hiſſing; alſo Tobacco Pipes, if one end be put into water, and the other brought near to the Ear, yield a certain ſharp noiſe and rumbling: add to theſe, that fixed Salts being Calcined, or having ſuffered a Flux by the Fire, become far ſharper; alſo Stygian waters, by reaſon of thoſe kind of little Bodies involved therein, which afterwards leiſurely evaporate, perpetually ſend forth ſharp fumes: and when theſe are poured upon Saline Calxes, not only an Ebullition is raiſed, by reaſon of the diſagreeing Particles of the Salts, which ſtrike one another mutually, whereby they might be more ſtrictly combined; but beſides, heat and ſmoak ſucceed, which for the moſt part ariſe from the fiery Particles being ſhuck out of their Dens. But it is not eaſie to give a reaſon why quick Lime, and no other Concretes, retain ſo copiouſly thoſe kind of fiery Particles, and yield a ſtrong heat, water being poured on them.</p>
                     <p>Tis plain enough that when the Sulphureous Effluviums of Fire, (foraſmuch as they are moſt penetrating) enter all Bodies whatſoever, brought near, affect them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer divers manners: thoſe which are more lax, and ſtuffed with active Principles, are deſtroyed wholly by burning, and becauſe their ſubſtance decays, the fiery Particles, as Soldiers in a City ſpoiled by themſelves, do not continue long in the ruined place,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:107016:27"/>but go farther, and move their Tents: but where the Concretion of the Subject is very compact, and that its Elements cannot be ſo pulled in pieces by the fire, that they rather grow ſtiff, as is ſeen in Metals, Glaſs, Bricks, and other things made hard, either by boiling, or fuſion; the fiery Particles entered in, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in an incommodious Inn, preſently go forth again; and therefore few are wont to ſtay in mixt things of this kind, or in things fuſed, or Calcined: but if fire be ſo applyed to the more hard Concretes, of which ſort are moſt ſtones, and ſhelly Concretes, that the bond of the mixture be unlocked, ſome parts, <hi>viz.</hi> the Watery and Sulphureous are driven away, and ſo ſome ſpaces are made hollow, very fit for the receiving any ſtranger; in the mean time, that the frame of the matter be not wholly deſtroyed, but that it may continue its compacted and ſtony form, which flows not away together with its Particles, and ever threatens its ruin; in ſuch a Subject, chiefly the Particles of fire, poſſeſſing the ſpaces of the parts flown away, copiouſly remain; and there cleaving cloſe to the Saline little Bodies, being detained one from another, by the coming be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween of the earthy, lie quiet; which notwithſtanding afterwards, being violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly driven from thoſe Inns, are able to produce by their eruption, an intenſe, and almoſt fiery heat: in the mean time thoſe Saline little Bodies, are ſo looſned, by the long familiarity of the fiery, and by the embrace of one another, and of the ſtrangers, that they become Volatile, and being diluted with water, for the greateſt part evaporate with it; and the remaining Salt, becauſe alſo Volatile, and having ſuffered almoſt a divorce from all the reſt of the Principles, is both ſweetiſh, and becomes deſirous of Conjunction, and aſtringent; and therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is of excellent uſe for plaſtring of Walls.</p>
                     <p>But that Stygian waters, being poured upon the Stagmas of fixed Salts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce heat, and the ſame mixed with Iron, or the Butter of Antimony, ſtir up a mighty ardor, with a blacking ſmoak, the reaſon ſeems plain. As to the Stygian waters and fixed Salts, it may be ſaid that both theſe Concretes are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salts, having got divers ſtates by the fire, and ſo either being very much ſtuffed with fiery Particles (which are the moſt minute atoms of Sulphur:) But they being confuſed together, do forthwith ruſh into mutual embraces, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Particles of either, are made unlike, therefore, whereby they may be more ſtrictly united, there is made a great attrition of parts, and together an excuſſion of the fiery Particles, from whence the great ebullition, with a heat is excited: when the ſame <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> are poured on Iron, or the Ice of Antimo, the Salts of either come together, and ſhake forth the fiery Particles, and alſo the Sulphureous Particles, before implanted in either Subject; which flying away in heaps, cauſe a ſmoak with a heat, but not a flame.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, as it is to be obſerved, in the Precipitation of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>WE have hitherto treated of the Solutions of Bodies; it remains now that we ſpeak of Precipitation, this is performed only in Liquids, which, when as they are ſtuffed with Heterogeneous Particles, are compelled by a matter Precipitating thoſe Particles, to ſeparate one from another, and to obtain for their ſubſtance, divers places and conditions: wherefore, ſince in this operation, there is an agitation and motion of parts, its conſideration ought to be referred to the Doctrine of Fermentation.</p>
                     <p>Precipitation is performed, either in Natural things, as thiefly in Milk, Blood, Urine, and perhaps in ſome others; or in Artificial things, which are of a diverſe Kind and Nature: but they may be deſcribed and ranked in a certain order, according as the Liquor to be Precipitated, or Precipitating, is either Spirituous, Sulphureous, Watery, or Saline: beſides, according as the Particles ſeparated from the reſt, are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Elementary, (<hi>viz.</hi> either Sulphureous, Earthy, or Saline) or Integral, which participate of the Nature of the whole mixture, and are only very ſmall portions of</p>
                     <p>There are two common and known ways of Precipitation, whereby is made from Milk, both Cheeſe, and Butter: As to the firſt, if any ſharp thing be poured into warm Milk, the thicker and Chceſie parts, preſently ſeparate from the ſerous and thinner, and are gathered together into a thick ſubſtance. The reaſon of which conſiſits in this: Milk has a ſomwhat thick conſiſtence, and its pores and paſſages are very much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, with the thicker (to wit the Cheeſie) contents; wherefore when ſomthing more ſubtil and penetrating, (as is Rennet) paſſes through the Liquor, it eaſily thruſts forth the more thick Particles, with which the pores were poſſeſſed; which then mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually Embrace one another, and are ſeparated a-part from the thin, and Eheyie Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor. When Milk is kept long to a ſourneſs, it is Precipitated after the ſame manner, without Rennet, by warming it over the fire. For in ſtale Milk its Saline parts get a Flux, then being ſtirred up by the fire, ſupply by their own ſoumeſs the turn of Rennet, yea it is not improbable that the fluid Salt in the Rennet provokes the Saline Particles of the Milk, into a Flux, and that for this reaſon chiefly its Coagulation ſucceeds: for that the Saline parts having gotten of their own accord a Flux, ſo bind the pores of the Liquor, that the more thick Contents are willingly exterminated from them: wherefore we do ſay, for that reaſon, the ſame thing happens, when a Flux of the ſame Salt is cauſed by ſome thing elſe put into it. But that the Coagulation of Milk happens, not only by reaſon of the paſſages and pores being poſſeſſed by a ſtrange Body, the ſign is; becauſe the Salt of Tartar, tho exceeding Precipitatory, effects nothing, of this, and this effect is excited almoſt only by ſour things. Sugar hinders the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation of Milk, and many other Liquors, becauſe it reſtrains the Flux of the Ace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Salt, and as it is eaſily Soluble, and its Particles are ſoft and blunt, they extrude not the former Contents implanted in the Liquor, but fill all vacuities, that afterwards there is no ſpace whereby another Precipitating Liquor may unfold it ſelf, and break into anothers quarters.</p>
                     <p>But Country people are wont to make Butter of the Flowers or Cream of Milk, kept for the moſt part to a ſourneſs, only by ſhaking or Churning it. The reaſon of which (as it ſeems to me) is this: in Cream there is great plenty of Sulphur, with which alſo a mean portion of Salt and Earth is mixed, as may be conjectured, both by the ſourneſs of the Liquor remaining of the Butter, or the Butter-Milk, and by its thicker conſiſtency. In this mixture, the parts both Saline and Sulphureous are in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Flux: but as the Liquor is thicker they cannot preſently fly away: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it remains, that if the bond of the mixture be further looſned, they will ſeparate into parts, and that firſt the Sulphureous Particles, which exceed the others in power, are Congregated together with a mutual embrace; wherefore theſe two things, the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:107016:28"/>Churning of the Cream performs, <hi>viz.</hi> it brings the Sulphureous parts by their often obvolution together, whereby they do the better intangle themſelves, and muturally enſnare one another; beſides it breaks their mixture with the reſt. For this reaſon, in the Winter time, (when Cream is thinner, and abounds leſs with Sulphur) Butter is hardly made. Beſides the admixtion of Salt or Sugar wholly hinders its making; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by the coming between of thoſe little Bodies, the Sulphureous parts are hindred, from a mutual adheſion.</p>
                     <p>The chief Precipitation of the blood, which is performed within a living Body, is made in the Reins; where, not without the ſtrength of a certain Coagulum or Rennet, the ſerus matter is ſeparated from the reſt of the blood; juſt as Whey from Milk: For which reaſon Diuretical things are of the ſame Nature, as thoſe which bring a Coagulation to Milk; and therefore, becauſe they more Precipitate the blood by ſuſing it, they cauſe a large profuſion of urine. The blood being ſent forth of the Veſſels, ſeparates into various ſubſtances, by its own diſpoſition: whilſt it is warm, it is variouſly Precipitated, by ſome Liquors poured to it, (in like manner Urine) not without a pleaſant Spectacle. If you pour upon warm blood the ſpirit of Wine, Harts Horn, Soot, Vitriol, or other Liquors, chiefly Spirituous or Saline, a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Ebullition and heat is ſtirred up; whence we may conjecture after what manner it grows turgid, in Feavers. But before the reſt. the Salt of Tartar, and a Soluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Alum, procure both in Blood and in Urin, a great perturbation of the Liquor, and falling down of the parts: for theſe diſturb all the Contents in the pores and paf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fages of the Liquor, and by their aſtriction, very much lock them up for a long time.</p>
                     <p>Precipitation in Artificial things is of greater note and uſe: for this for the moſt part floolws Diſſolutions, and ſucceeds them as it were by a certain right of Order; becauſt this takes out to their Jaws, and as it were lays by, the prey, which all <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua</hi> take by diſſolving. According to the diverſity of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and of the Body diſſolved, Precipitation alſo variouſly happens: but in ſome Subjects there are two chief remarkable things, concerning the manner of Precipitation, to wit, the ſoluted Particles, immerſed in the pores and paſſages of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are wont to fall out of them; either by reaſon of the narrowneſs of the conteining ſpace, or elſe by reaſon of the Contents being increaſed in weight and bigneſs: for in ſome the pores of the Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, being either leiſurely bound up, or beſet with a ſtrange Body, ſhut forth from their Cells, the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted, and ſend them to the bottom; as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in Sulphureous Solutions, or ſuch as are made of the whole mixture of integral parts, in a thin Liquor; which are diſturbed, and lay away their Contents by external cold, ſimple water, or at leaſt by any Acid infuſion. After this manner reſinous Tinctures, alſo of Sulphur, Olibanum, Benzoin, and the infuſions and decoctions of Vegetables, alſo Urin, Milk, and Blood, are wont to be Precipitated: but in ſeveral others, beſides that the pores, and paſſages of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> are either leiſurely drawn together, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by a new gueſt, alſo ſomthing new grows to the Particles of the thing ſoluted from the Precipitating matter, whereby being increaſed in weight and bulk, they can be no longer ſuſtained; but that they are neceſſitated to ſink to the bottom. This is chiefly ſeen in the Saline Solutions of Minerals, which are only Precipitated by the Salts; whoſe Particles preſently cleave to the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted, and increaſe their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that preſently they deſcend to the bottom by their own weight: For in Saline ſolutions, the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted, are ſtrictly bound together by the fluid <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> with the Saline Particles; and the Particles run haſtily and are heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the Embraces of the ſame fluid Salt, from the Precipitating infuſion of the fixed Salt: wherefore, when theſe three, (to wit, the little Bodies of either Salt, and of the ſoluted matter) do cohere together, they conſtitute greater grains than can be eontained in the narrow ſpaces of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and therefore being thruſt out, they fall down towards the bottom: That this does truly happen after this manner, the great affinity, both of the fluid and fixed Salt, is a ſign; that the Particles of both being placed near or mixed together, are preſently combined in one: alſo, becauſe many ſolutions of Minerals, are preſently Precipitated by a fixed Salt, but not by Vitriol or Alum be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put in, which do much more bind, and ſtop up the pores of the Liquor. Thirdly, it appears clearly even to ſenſe, becauſe that the matter put for a Precipitate, far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the thing ſoluted in bulk and weight, and is impregnated by the fixed Salt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to it, But theſe being thus diſpoſed, we will deſcend to the particular caſes of Percipitations, foraſmuch as Precipitation is made manifold, to wit, according to the diverſity of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> of the ſoluted matter, and the Precipitating infuſion.</p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:107016:28"/>
                     <p>Simple water, though it do not well ſuſtain the Particles of the mixture which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives into it ſelf by infuſion, or Coheſion, yet hardly ſends them away by Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the pores of this <hi>Menſtruum</hi> are too open and looſe, wherefore the Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitating matter, doth not eaſily ſtrike the little Bodies of the thing ſoluted: in the mean time, by reaſon of the more looſe frame of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> ſome parts of the ſoluted Body ſink down; others of their own accord evaporate, from whence that Liquor doth not long keep the Virtues or Tincture, with which they are impregnated by another. As ſome more thick parts and Terreſtrial may be thruſt down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or otherways ſeparated, we put in the Juice of Limons, or ſome acid thing, or boil in it the whites of Eggs, to wit, that whatſoever is thick might cleave to their viſcous ſubſtance.</p>
                     <p>Spirituous and Sulphureous <hi>Menſtrua,</hi> being impregnated with the Sulphureous Particles of the thing ſoluted, eaſily lay by their burthen; for they are Precipitated by common, or any Diſtilled water; as is ſeen in Sulphureous and Reſinous Tinctures of Sulphur, Scammony, Benzoin, Frankincenſe, and others of that kind prepared by the Spirit of Wine, or Oylof Turpentine, which preſently grow Milky, by Water or Phlegm being infuſed. For in theſe ſort of ſolutions, the pores are wholly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that they admit nothing beſides the thing ſoluted, and beſides, both the Liquor, and ſoluted Matter are ſo thin, that they eaſily give place to any thing elſe being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Menſtruas</hi> of this kind are filled with Saline Particles, as we may obſerve in the Tinctures of the Salt of Corrals, of Tartar and ſuch like, Precipitation does not preſently ſucceed from common water, but from an Acid Liquor, as the Spirit of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Salt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Saline <hi>Menſtruas</hi> impregnated by the ſolutions of Stones or Metals, are moſt eaſily Precipitated by Saline Particles, and ſcarce by others. The chief Precipitatory Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, is the Salt of Tartar, or of Herbs burnt to Aſhes, deliquated or melted; for this ſtrikes back the Particles of every ſoluted thing whatſoever, and ſends them head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the bottom; to wit, foraſmuch, as it paſſes through every where, the little ſpaces of the ſolvent, and ſticking to the Contents, increaſes them in bulk, that they more eaſily fall out of the pores of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> bound alſo together with their own weight.</p>
                     <p>What fluid Salt (as Vinegar, Stygian waters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) diſſolves, the ſame a fixed Salt precipitates; and on the contrary: becauſe Salt of Tartar being melted, moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently penetrates common Sulphur, and receives the Tincture; which then is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated by a fluid Salt, <hi>viz.</hi> by the Spirit of Vitriol, and the like: which indeed does not happen, by reaſon of the diſagreeing Particles of the Salts, and mutually oppoſing one another; but for that the ſame are greatly of kin, and ruſh into mutual Embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for from hence, the little grains of the thing ſoluted, by reaſon of the cohering of both the Salts together, being increaſed in bulk and weight, are more readily thruſt out of the little ſpaces of the <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> and deſcend to the bottom. We will in this place, more ſparingly inſiſt upon inſtances of this nature, becauſe the more full hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of them belongs to the Chymical Work.</p>
                     <p>Precipitation is not only obſerved in the ſeparation of a more thick matter, from a ſerous <hi>latex,</hi> and in the ſettling of the diſturbed parts towards the bottom; but ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Particles ſhut up within the pores and paſſages of the Liquor, are ſo ſmall and ſubtil, that being Precipitated, they are not diſcerned by the ſight, neither do they quickly deſcend to the bottom; but from their ſituation and poſition, being va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly changed, the colour, and conſiſtency of the Liquor, are diverſly altered. I was wont in times paſt, to ſport with the ſolutions of Vegetables and Minerals, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made by themſelves, were clear like Spring water, and appeared bright, being commixed, ſhewed now a Black colour, now a Milky, Red, Green, Blue, or ſome other kind. The ſolution of Saturn, (or Lead) being made with diſtilled Vinegar, appears bright like common water, if you add to this Oil of Tartar, like clear water, the mixture ſtraight grows White like Milk. If Antimony calcined with Nitre, be boiled in Spring water, the ſtraining ſeems clear, and almoſt without ſmell, which yet being daſhed by any Acid thing. preſently acquires a deep yellow colour, with a moſt wicked ſtink. Common water being imbued by an infuſion of Mercury Sublimate, is preſently tinged with yellowneſs, by Oyl of Tartar dropped into it. Quickſilver and Sal Armoniack, being beaten together, and Sublimated in a Matrace by the heat of Sand, go into a white powder, this being ſoluted by melting ſhows like to clear Spring
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:107016:29"/>water, which yet being ſmeared upon Braſs or Copper, appears like Silver; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lightly rubbed on braſen Veſſels, renders them as if they were perfectly ſilvered. A ſolution of Calcined Tin, being put to melted Salt of Tartar becomes bluiſh. A clear infuſion of Galls, being mixt with a ſolution of Vitriol, makes Ink; if you add to this Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian water, the black Liquor is by and by made clear like Spirit of Vitriol, or Stygian water, the black Liquor is by and by made clear like Spring water; and this Oil of Tartar reduces again to Ink. And what is more wonderful, if you write on Paper with the clear infuſion of Vitriol, and frame any Letters; what you ſo write preſently vaniſhes, nor is there any marks of the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters left: but if you ſmear over the Paper with an infuſion of Galls, preſently the Letters may be read, as if wrote with Ink; which yet, with a Pen run over, dipt in Spirit of Vitriol, you may put quite out at once wetting, and then again reder them, with wetting them with another Liquor of Tartar. The Sky-colour Tincture of Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, being daſhed with Oil of Vitriol, becomes of a Purple colour: to which, if you add ſome drops of the Spirit of Harts Horn, that Purple colour is changed into Green. Braſil Wood, being infuſed in common water, leaves a very pleaſant Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, like to Claret Wine; if you pour to this a little diſtilled Vinegar, the Liquor appears clear like White Wine: a few drops of Oil of Tartar reduces it to a deep Purple colour: then if the Spirit of Vitriol be poured in, it becomes of a pale yellow, like to Sack; if you add the Salt of Lead, being ſoluted by deliquation, the mixture grows preſently Milky: by this means you may imitate that famous Water-drinker, who having ſwallowed down a great deal of Spring water, was wont to vomit forth into Glaſſes placed before him, diverſly coloured Liquors, reſembling the ideas of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers kinds of Wines: for Glaſſes being medicated with the aforeſaid Tinctures, (ſo lightly that they may not be perceived by the ſtanders by) will not only cauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter poured into them, to imitate every Wine, but will exhibit the very Proteus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the Poets, changed into waters, and from thence putting on all colours, and infinite forms.</p>
                     <p>If a Reaſon of theſe kind of appearances be asked, it ought to be ſought in the minute Particles, contained within the pores of every Liquor; which as to their ſite and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, being diverſly altered, by another Liquor infuſed, tranſmit variouſly the Rays of Light, many ways break or reflect them, and ſo make divers appearances of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. For when the Rays of Light paſs through almoſt in right Lines, they make a clear colour like Spring water; but if in their paſſage, they be a little broken, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor grows yellowiſh; but being more refracted, they cauſe a red colour; if they are bowed back, ſo as to be drained, or that they cannot ſhew themſelves, a dark or black colour ariſes; but if they are again reflected, to the outmoſt Superficies of the Liquor, they create the image of Whiteneſs: after this manner we might variouſly Philoſophiſe about other colours, and their appearances, the diverſity of which, and ſudden alterations in Liquids, depend chiefly on Precipitation: becauſe, as the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles conteined in the Liquor, are driven ſomtimes more near by another infuſion that they claſp themſelves together; ſomtimes are ordered into other ſeries of poſitions, the diverſe repreſentation of colours is made. For Liquor being impregnated with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies or Atoms, or this Nature, moſt minutely broken, ſeems as an Army of Soldiers placed in their Ranks, who now draw into cloſe Order, now open their Files and Ranks, now turn to the left, now to the right hand, as is diverſly ſhown in the exerciſing of Tacticks, or the Art Military. When two clear Liquors being mixed together ſhall make Ink, it is becauſe the Particles conteined in either, approach near one another, and as it were placed in their cloſe Orders hinder the paſſage of the beams of light: when afterwards, this Ink is made clear by another Liquor poured in, it is becauſe the new Bodies of the thing put in, diſperſe abroad the former cloſe joyned Particles, and drive them as it were into their open Orders.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of the motion of Fermentation, as it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Coagulation, and the Congelation of Bodies.</head>
                     <p>OOagulation and Congelation of Natural Bodies, no leſs than their Solution, depend only on theſe our Principles. The improportionate mixture of theſe, and the exaltation, and powerfulneſs of ſome above others, are the cauſe of either. Sprit and Sulphur being looſned from the bond, do not only pull aſſunder the proper Subjects, but the ſet upon whatever is next them; and where they are mighty in number and ſtrength, they affect nothing more than divorces and ſeparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the reſt of the Principles, and ſuffer no delay: but on the contrary, Salts love to be united to the reſt, and to be made into hard and ſolid ſubſtances; and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the Company of the reſt, preſently to enter into new Friendſhips, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire only not to be joyned to any oppoſite. If at any time they are more impetuouſly moved, either by their own diſpoſition, or being ſoluted, they deſtroy the ſubſtance of others, this thing ſeems to be done for this end, deſtinated as it were by Nature, that they might find out Subjects agreeable to themſelves, and having through War ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained Peace, they might at length be more ſtrictly united to them: wherefore when Saline <hi>Menſtruums</hi> corrode Stones or Metals, they are Coagulated with their Particles, and grow together into diverſly figured Cryſtals.</p>
                     <p>When we here treat of Coagulation, we do not take this word after the uſual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: to wit, as it is wont to be vulgarly uſurped, when Milk is become congealed, that is, departs from its ſimple and equal Liquor into Heterogeneous ſubſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> Cheeſe, or Curds and Whey, or thick and thin; in like manner, when blood or other humors go into parts after that manner, they are ſaid to be coagulated: alſo, we have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where given this ſenſe, to this word, tho to ſpeak properly, theſe ſort of motions ought rather to be referred to Precipitation than to Coagulation. But here we would have to be underſtood, by the term Coagulation, an alteration in Bodies of the ſame kind, as when things at firſt tender and ſoft, grow hard, into a ſtiff, and as it were ſtony matter: or any thing is ſaid to coagulate, when Saline little Bodies being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed abroad in any Subject, begin to be congregated and joyned together, and from thence united, either among themſelves or with Earth, produce out of a ſoft and fluid ſubſtance, a hard and compacted. This may be perceived in the ſhells clearly ſtony, of Fruits and Seed; in Bones and Horns of living Creatures, in Shells and Shelly ſcurffs of Fiſhes; all which indeed very much abound with an Alcali Salt, or the ſame Volatilized. Among Handicrafts, or preparations from human Induſtry, the Cryſtaliſation, Vitrification of Salts, or making of Glaſs, alſo the baking of Pots and Earthen ware, ought to be referred to Coagulation.</p>
                     <p>But it is properly called Congelation, when the Saline Particles, coming from elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, ſtrictkly bind together the Subjects on which they fall, fix the Particles variouſly moved within the ſubſtance of the mixture, and gather them together, that by that means the whole becomes ſtiff, and as it were ſtony. We may behold theſe kind of effects in Ice and Froſt, by which ſoft Mud, or fluid Springs of waters grow ſtiff, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a very Marble ſubſtance. Alſo the ſame is manifeſtly beheld, among the Operations of Art, in the confuſions of ſome Salts, and mutual Concretion in Sublimating; by which means, they go into a ſubſtance, now like to Ice, now to Snow. To which may be added the Artificial turning of water to Ice, which is performed by the mixture of Salt and Snow; but the inſtances which we have remarked in either of theſe, about the Works of Art, we will in this place briefly run through, and a little conſider the reaſons of them, and the ways of being done.</p>
                     <p>The Cryſtaliſation of Salts, is procured after this manner; Salts of every kind are throughly diſſolved in common water, and their Particles being diſperſed through the whole maſs of the Liquor, wholly diſappear; afterwards, if this liquor be ſomwhat
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:107016:30"/>evaporated, that its paſſages and pores be ſomthing bound together, the little Bodies of the Salt cloſe one with another, and mutually take hold of themſelves, and joyn together, the outward cold binding them, and are figured in the midſt of the water, into Cryſtals proper to their Nature. By this means <hi>Sal</hi> Nitre into Pyramids, Sea Salt into Cubes, Alum into eight cornered Figures, <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniack into ſix cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nered, and other Salts are formed into other Figures of their own accord, after a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant manner.</p>
                     <p>If the Reaſon of this be ſought after, we ſay that theſe kind of Salts are not ſimple Elements, but Bodies made up of abundance of Salt, with the other Elements mixed with them in ſmall quantity; which even as other Natural Concretes, are allotted by the firſt Creator, peculiar manners of figurations, according to the ſurpaſſing ſtrength of Salt and Spirit, and commixion with the reſt. For in determining the Figures of Natural Bodies, Spirit and Salt are as the Rule and Compaſs in deſcribing Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Figures: Spirit, as the moveable Foot of the Compaſs, or as a Penſil in the hand of an Artiſt, variouſly excurs and draws here and there diverſe faſhioned lineaments. But ſalt (as the applyed Rule) moderates the excurſions of the other, and determinates them, and reſtrains them within the confines deſigned by Nature: when the Spirit is more powerful than the Salt, there happens a greater variety in the Figuration of things, as in Vegetables and Animals; becauſe the Spirit running forth more largely, forms very many Marks of its Pourtracture, and deſcribes Bodies not in right Lines, but intorted, and very much variegated. Where the Salt Lords it over the Spirit, as in Mineral Concretes, and chiefly Saline; Bodies grow together in leſs adorned Figures, and are accounted the firſt and more ſimple, and of that ſort, as the Mathematical deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in right Lines or Circles. For thoſe Salts, are as it were ſecond Elements; and from the implanting of them in Bodies, the proper and native Figures of things, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much depend; and therefore they themſelves are primitively imbued by Nature with a certain Elementary Configuration, (ſo that according to <hi>Plato,</hi> God in truth exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes Geometry) and the firſt regular Figures are formed in the more ſimple, that things compounded of them, might ariſe furniſhed with all manner of variety of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures.</p>
                     <p>The fixed Salts of Herbs being prepared by Calcination, becauſe they are almoſt deſtitute of the Fellowſhip of Spirits, do ſcarce go at all into Cryſtals, nor are they coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated, but by a long evaporation. Sea Salt containing a very little Spirit, with great Labour goes into Cubes. Next to this Alum, guifted with a little more Spirit, is more eaſily coagulated, and grows into more elaborate Figures, <hi>viz.</hi> eight cornered <hi>Sal</hi> Nitre, ſwelling with ſpirit, is moſt eaſily coagulated, and is framed into a more perfect Figure, <hi>viz.</hi> Pyramidical; which conſiſts of both Spherical, and Right Lines. But Volatile Salt, (ſuch as is diſtilled out of Urine, Blood, and the Horns of living Creatures) being aſſociated with a plentiful Spirit, is drawn into Concretes, very much varying, which imitate now the Horns of Staggs. now the Figures of Plants. Out of Mercury, with Salt, or the Calx of Silver, by an Amalgama, in the midſt of the waters a Silver Tree is formed, with Stock, Trunk and Branches, painted to the Life. It is a uſual thing in the Winter time, for the Air, impregnated with Saline Vapors, and fallen on the Glaſs Windows, to be condenſed into moſt fair Firgures of Trees and Woods. So much for the Cryſtalliſation of Salts: The other Species of Coagulation, is Vitrification, of which we will ſpeak next.</p>
                     <p>Vitrification (which is alſo ſaid to be the laſt mutation of Bodies, of which Nature is capable, and from which there is no going back) depends upon a fuſed Salt, and united to an Earthy matter, even to its ſmalleſt Particle: for when either matter is fuſed, by a moſt vehement fire, and divided in its ſmalleſt parts, the Bodies of either, being put into a Flux, are by ſo ſtrict a marriage joyned together, that afterwards they are never to be pulled aſſunder.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways, and diverſe proviſions of Vitrification, to wit, of <hi>Sal Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cali,</hi> with Sand or a ſandy matter fuſed together by a violent fire, common Glaſs is made; which is tranſparent, both by reaſon of the abundance of Salt, and of the clearneſs of the Sand; for if you behold the little Sands of which Glaſs is made, with a Microſcope, each of their little Globes appear, (as they were Glaſſie Gems) clear and ſhining. Wherefore Salt promotes; the fuſion of that clear matter by fire, and then is admitted into its moſt ſtrict embraces being fuſed.</p>
                     <p>Beſides Glaſſes of diverſe Colours and Conſiſtences are made of Minium, the Calx of Tinn, Antimony, and ſome other Minerals, (when the Sulphureous part doth firſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:107016:30"/>fly away) fuſed, now by themſelves, now with Flint or Sandy matter. The reaſon of all which conſiſts in this; that Salt and Earth, being moſt ſmally broken by a violent fuſion of fire, and being divided as to their leaſt Particles, catch hold of one another, and ſo are bound together, by the moſt ſtrict bond of the mixture. The Coalition or Coupling of theſe, is never to be diſſolved, becauſe there is wanting within in the mixture, other Principles, which might unlock the frame of the Subject: yea Salt and Earth, being joyned by the mediating fire, do ſo intimately cohere, that they affect not divorces of themſelves, nor ſuffer them from another.</p>
                     <p>The baking of Earthen Pots and Bricks, is of kin to Vitrification (or making of Glaſs) whereby moiſt and ſoft Clay is ſtifned into a very ſtony hardneſs: But in theſe, there is greater plenty of Earth, and leſs of Salt; wherefore they are leſs brittle, and not tranſparent. Concerning theſe we ſay, that by the fire mediating, and as it were handying the ſmalleſt, broken, and divided Particles of Salt, are married to every Particle of the Earthy matter, and with them grow hard, into as it were a ſtony ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and that not eaſily to be reſolved. Alſo in theſe kind of matters, prepared by human Induſtry, we imitate indeed, with an excellent Artifice, the Concretions of Bones and Stones, made by Nature in divers Families of Animals, Vegetables, and Minerals.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects Congelation; Salts of a diverſe kind, do often meet together, and grow ſtiff, into as it were a new ſubſtance: But this happens many ways. Of theſe, ſome Salts being mixed together, preſently grow together into Cryſtals: for the Acid Spirits of Minerals being added to the Salts of Tartar, or thoſe made of the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Vegetables turn into a white Coagulum like Snow, and with a ſpumeous or frothy Heat: The reaſon of which is, that the Particles of the Salt, having gotten a Flux, take hold of other Salts in the Spirit, Alcaliſate by melting; but by reaſon of the firſt Particles of either, being made unlike, there ariſes a ſtrife; then form the ſame conſociated in one, that white ſettlement is made.</p>
                     <p>Not unlike the ſame manner, theſe Acetous Spirits, to wit, of Vitriol, Nitre, Salt, and others being mixed with Metals, while they corrode them, are Cryſtalliſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Saline Particles: ſo the Spirits of Vitriol, Nitre, alſo Stygian waters, (which are only Salts having gotten a Flux) are formed into moſt elegant Cryſtals, in the diſſolving of Silver, Iron, Copper, and other things. For Salts, even as Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, being looſned from the mixture, diſſolve other mixtures, and greedily deſire to be united with the Homogeneous Particles of the ſame Subject.</p>
                     <p>There is another manner of Congelation, when Salts being mixed with ſome other matter, are elevated by Sublimation out of their Subjects, and then congeal the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of that new matter, which they carry away with them, and grow together with them (like a Meteor) on high: after this manner the Salts of Vitriol, Nitre and Sea-Salt, being ſublimated with Mercury, are congealed as it were into a ſnowy ſubſtance: The ſame being ſublimed with Antimony, go into a matter like Ice. After this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the Natural Congelations, by which ſome Minerals, and chiefly Vitriols and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, are begot in the Bowels of the Earth, may be imitated. For of Iron and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are prepared factitious Vitriols, which are very like the Natural: Of Antimony Sulphur is made, which anſwers to an hair our common Sulphur in taking fire, colour and ſmell: for example pour Oyl of Vitriol, to the height of a fingers breadth, upon pulveriſed Antimony; and let it be diſtilled in a Retort in a Sand Furnace, a yellow Sulphur will be ſublimed in the Neck of the Retort, that cannot be diſcerned from the common Sulphur: which is a ſign that the Concretion of Sulphur is made in the Earth, when ſome Sulphureous Mineral is corroded by the Salt of Vitriol, whoſe Sulphureous parts are congealed by the ſame Salt. This alſo is an Argument, that Oyl of Sulphur, which is ſeparated, by inkindling under a Bell from the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous matter, is nothing elſe but Vitriolic Salt, nor doth any thing differ from Oyl of Vitriol.</p>
                     <p>Artificial Congelation concludes inſtances and examples of Congelations: to wit, whereby common water, or any Liquors being put over the fire, or in an Hot Houſe, are ſuddenly congealed into Ice: 'tis a common way, and vulgarly known, Salt being mixed with Snow and Ice, and agitated or ſhaken in a Veſſel put into water, ſuddenly the water about the ſides of the Veſſel will be frozen. This will be done if you make tryal of it, either with common Salt, or Sea-Salt, Nitre, or alſo with Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol, Alum, <hi>Sal</hi> Armoniac, or Mercury Sublimate: For Salt of every kind, being put to Snow or Ice, looſens their mixtures, and ſends away the Nitrous and Conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:107016:31"/>Particles from the Subjects; which preſently being immerſed in the neighbouring water, Congeal it, as if they were freſhly blown from the North.</p>
                     <p>What is more admirable; let a diſh with Snow be placed over hot Coals, and in the middle of the Snow put a Glaſs full of water: as the Snow is melted by degrees by the fire, the water ſhall be frozen: for the Nitrous Particles, being driven away by the heat, by their departure, they are daſhed againſt the neighbouring water and congeal it.</p>
                     <p>And thus much for FERMENTATION in general, and briefly of its various parts; it had been almoſt an infinite Labour, and from our purpoſe, to heap up inſtances in ſo diffuſe a thing. Thoſe hitherto brought, however choſen out of Natural Philoſophy, were fit to wait upon the following Medical diſſertation, that we may more happily know the Original, Progreſs, and State, as alſo the Remedies and Cure of Motions, and Mutations, in Cauſes, which variouſly happen to all kind of Bodies, and ſomwhat reſpecting the Tumults, which from thence are begot in the human Body, from the blood being irritated, and the reſt of the humors; to which exerciſe, God willing, we will now proceed.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O Inſtitute in this Age a new Doctrine of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, may perhaps ſeem the ſame thing, as if any one ſhould go about to deſcribe the midſt of our Country, for a Land before unknown. For what reſpect the <hi>Diagnoſis</hi> of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, ſeem to be firmly Eſtabliſhed already, by the Precepts and Practice of the Antients and Moderns; yea by long Experience, they are ſo generally in the mouth, and known of all men, that nothing can be more. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I deſerve pardon, if I a little receed from the Vulgar Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion concerning Feavers, as a way mightily worn out; and go in a leſs trodden Path; becauſe I am not the firſt, or only man that directs his courſe againſt the received Opinion, as againſt a Stream. For in truth, in the Medical Art, (and that deſervedly) thoſe things have not pleaſed the men of our Age, which did thoſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: becauſe the Antients relying on a falſe Poſition concerning the motion of the Blood; proceeding as it were through ſlippery and moiſt places, often fell foully and dangerouſly: wherefore it is no wonder, if thoſe who come after ſhould take care for the thorough inſtauration of Phyſick, and for the Re-Edifying the Building, (as they ſay) even from the ground, the Antient Props being fallen down, on that which our moſt Famous <hi>Harvy</hi> hath laid, the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, as a new Foundation in Medicine. But in this Work, Learned men of other Countrys, but chiefly of our own, have happily laboured, not only in removing the Rubbiſh of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Building, but for the ſupplying this plentifully with Stone, Planks, and other matter. In times paſt, among the Antients, as the diſtribution and Natural motion, of the Nutritious humor, of the Blood and Nervous juice; ſo the Feaveriſh heats, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural motions of them, were wholly hidden and lay in the dark: but now new Lights have ſhined forth, and it is granted us to know the Cauſes of things before hidden, it doth not become pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, and profeſsing Philoſophy, even to ſhut their Eyes and remain blind in the Light it ſelf; but eſpecially about a Diſeaſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:107016:32"/>by which the third part of Mortals have ſtill fallen to this day, to be rather willing to Err with the Antients, than to underſtand the Truth with the Moderns, or to believe what is more likely, argues a mind guilty of notable ſtubbornneſs. When therefore the Puretology or Feaver Tracts of former Medicine, had no firm and ſtable Baſis, and that it is eaſie to ſhew that it was built upon very many, and plainly falſe Errors, what ſhould hinder, but that we having gotten more certain Principles, ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to erect a better Science concerning Feavers? Truly I think it would hardly be, altho the pleas of the Antients, ſhould be yet openly maintained in the Schools, but that many Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have a mind to look within the Bark, would frame new Hypotheſes to themſelves from their own Ratiocination, by which they might more exactly quadrate the Phaenomena of Feavers, than by that of the Antients. But it may be objected, that Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers have been happily cured by the ſame Remedies, and the like method of Curing, from the times of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> even to our days; and therefore it may ſeem a raſh Work and little ſafe, that we ſhould endeavour new things, after having had the Experience of ſo many Ages, eſpecially ſince it is about the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body. To this it will be eaſie to anſwer, that Medicine was at firſt Empirical, and Remedies were not invented by general Precepts, or by Rule, but by the frequent trial of ſeveral things: And if led by the Example of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> his Followers had only poliſhed his Obſervations and Experiments, without doubt the Medicinal Art had grown up better, more handſomly, and with greater benefit to the Sick. But that the Light, clearly inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Antients, did ſo ſuddenly ſhut up, and darkned the Eyes of Poſterity, it was, the prepoſterous ſtudy of thoſe, who too baſtily framed, almoſt out of their own Brain, Phyſick into a general Method, after the manner of ſome Speculative Science: for by this means, before they had laid a firm Foundation, a ſufficiently ſpecious, and deceitful Pile of unſtable Doctrine, was erected. That therefore in the Cure of Feavers, ſome Indications being more antiently received, remain yet confirmed, and are to be perpetually obſerved, is to be aſcribed wholly to Experience, the firſt Miſtreſs of this Art, and not to the Precepts of Scholars. And from hence, I hope for my ſelf, to have gotten a defence ſufficient enough; for if the Opinions wholly erronious of the Antients, had not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but that the practice of Medicine, at firſt inſtituted by a certain induction of obſervations; had proceeded commodiouſly enough; the Theory being joyned with Truth, would have brought much leſs hurt to the Sick; or have leſs carried away thoſe exerciſing Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:107016:32"/>quite contrary from that Path, which Antiquity had left com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us. In the mean time, 'tis not to be diſſembled, that naked Experience, without the helps of Method and Reaſon avails little, yea very often doth much hurt; for neither are the ſame Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, every where to be driven away by the ſame Remedies. But he ſeems to have hit the mark, who joyns both together, that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may not pervert Experiments, and Nature it ſelf, not that this may remove Reaſon from its place. Altho that I know well enough, I have not obtained it, yet I will freely profeſs, that I have aimed at this Mark; and perhaps I may have deſerved ſome praiſe, even in failing in theſe ſort of Adventures; for after I had not found in Books, what might ſatisfie a mind deſirous of Truth, I reſolved with my ſelf, to ſearch into living and breathing Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples: and therefore ſitting oftentimes by the Sick, I was wont carefully to ſearch out their Caſes, to weigh all the ſymptoms, and to put them, with exact Diaries of the Diſeaſes, into writing; then diligently to meditate on theſe, and to compare ſome with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and then began to adapt general Notions from particular Events: and when by this means, for a long time, obſerving the Accidents and Courſes of Feavers, I had buſied my ſelf, for the finding out forms of Reaſons for their Cure, at length a new Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thology of this Diſeaſe was conceived in my mind; which afterwards, by the frequent increaſing Concourſe of Obſervations, as it were the Juice and Blood, was formed by degrees into a Child, ſuch as it now appears. But the Infant, which I had ordered to be kept cloſely, in our private houſe, being remarkable for Paradoxes, as it were a monſtrous ſhape, the importune diligence of Friends has taken care to bring abroad being gotten forth of my hands, and to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly beheld. What therefore is there ſaid concerning Feavers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the common manner, I would not have any one eſteem it brought forth by me, as from a Doctor in the Chair: doubting, I bring theſe thoughts into Public, and ſubmit them to the Examination and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the more Learned. That others before me have not ſpoken all things truly concerning this thing, ſhall be an Argument that I may Err, yea (if you pleaſe) that I have Erred: however, if I ſhould have rightly traced forth any marks, in this, at leaſt new ſearch of Truth; and ſhall have incited others (who are far better able) by this occaſion, to the full finiſhing of it; it will not repent me altogether of this, tho raſh beginning.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Doctrine of Fermentation being explicated, it remains that we handle the chief Inſtance or Example of it, to wit <hi>Feavers.</hi> For it ſeems that a Feaver is only a Fermentation, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Heat, brought into the blood and humors. Its name is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from <hi>Februo</hi> (or <hi>Purgament,</hi> which alſo is derived from <hi>Ferveo</hi> to be Hot) which word indeed is commodiouſly put to every Feaver, for that the blood in this Diſeaſe grows hot, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, by its fervor, as working muſt, it is Purged from its fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſes. But that this Fermentation or Feaveriſh efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, may be rightly explicated, theſe three things are to be conſidered. Firſt, What the Fermenting Liquor is; whether only blood, or any humors beſides. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, In what Principles in the mixture, and in what proportion of them, this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor conſiſts. Thirdly and laſtly, By what motion and turgeſcency of thoſe parts, or Particles, of which the blood is made, the Feaveriſh efferveſcency is ſtirred up. Theſe being thus premiſed, the Doctrin of Feavers ſhall be delivered, not from the Opinions of others, but acccording to the compariſons of Reaſons, picked (tho from ours, yet) from diligent and frequent obſervation, and confirmed by certain Experiments; all which however, I willingly ſubmit to the judgment of the more skilful.</p>
                     <p>It plainly appears, even to the ſenſe, that the Blood doth hugely boil up and rage in a Feaver, for every one (tho rude and unskilful) being in a Feaver, complains of the blood being diſtempered, and of the ſame growing hot in the Veſſels, and as it were put into a fury. Alſo, beſides the blood raging in the Veins and Arteries, it may be lawfully ſuſpected, that that juice with which the Brain and Nervous parts are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, is wont oftentimes to be in fault; for when this Liquor is ſeen to be carried back from the blood, into the Nervous ſtock by a conſtant motion, and certain Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and from thence through the Lymphatick Veſſels, into the Boſom of the blood, it is probable, if by reaſon of a taint contracted from the blood, that humor be depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in its diſpoſition, or is perverted from its equal motion, that from thence, the Rigor, and Pain, Convulſion, Dilerium, Phrenſie, and many more ſymptoms of the Nervous kind, uſual in Feavers, do ariſe.</p>
                     <p>After the Blood and Nervous Liquor, two other humors, for that being apt to grow hot, fall into our conſideration, <hi>viz.</hi> The Chyme or nouriſhing Juice, continually coming to the Maſs of Blood, and the ſerous Latex, perpetually departing from the ſame, which tho they be the firſt and laſt Liquors ſeparated from the Blood, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from it, yet being confuſed with it, they ought to be eſteemed as its aſſociate parts, or complements: For the nouriſhable Juice being freſh brought, is accounted the Crude part of the blood, and to be aſſimilated; and the <hi>Serum,</hi> its ſtale part, and to be carried away. And after this manner, ſo long as either are Circulated with the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:107016:34"/>blood it ſelf, in the Veſſels they participate of the heats of the firſt begotten blood, and oftentimes occaſionally begin them, or increaſe them being begun: but by what means theſe things come to be done, is declared hereafter in their proper places. As to the reſt of humors, which are only the recrements of the Nutritious juice, or the blood, when they are included, either in their proper Receptacles, or conſtrained in the narrow ſpaces, in the Viſcera, neither waſh the ſeveral parts of the Body with a continual luſtration, as the blood or Nervous Liquor, or the other humors but now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, are to be exempted from this rank; ſomtimes perhaps they may be the occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe that the blood doth conceive an undue Efferveſcency, or that it perſiſts in it longer; but it is only the blood, (with the Nervous Liquor, the alible juice, and <hi>Serum</hi> aſſociates) which boiling up above meaſure, with its heat, and ſtirred up with a rage through the Veſſels, diffuſes the preternatural heat, and induces the formal rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Feaver: but how this comes to be done, is not to be known plainly, but by a more near beholding the Nature of Blood, and as it were an Anatomy made of its Liquor.</p>
                     <p>There are in the Blood (as in all Fermentative Liquors) Heterogeneous Particles which as they are of a diverſe Figure and Energy, remain a long while in the mixture, by their mutual oppoſing one another and ſubaction, the motion of Fermentation is continually conſerved; as is perceived in Wine, Beer, and other Liquors: then, if the mixtion of the Liquor be ſomwhat unlocked by the adding of Ferments, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particles being freed from their bonds, do yet more ſwell up and induce Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, with a more rapid motion and heat: which is ſeen in a familiar Experiment of the Chymiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> when fluid Salts are mixed with Saline Liquors of another kind; from thence a great heat and ebullition are ſtirred up. Wherefore we ought to inquire concerning the Blood, of what Particles it conſiſts, that it ſhould be fit to Ferment, (as Wine, Beer, and other Liquors) of its own Nature: then by the help of what kind of Ferments, both its Natural and Feaveriſh heats are performed, with warmth, and a more quick motion.</p>
                     <p>The Maſs of the Blood by the opinion of the Antients, was thought to conſiſt of four humors, to wit, Blood, Phlegm, Choler and Melancholy: and it was affirmed, that according to the eminency of this, or that humor, diverſe temperaments are formed; and that by reaſon of their fervors or exorbitances, almoſt all Diſeaſes do ariſe. This Opinion, tho it flouriſhed from the time of <hi>Galen,</hi> in the Schools of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, yet in our Age, in which the Circular motion of the Blood, and other affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of it were made known, before not underſtood, it began to be a little ſuſpected; nor to be ſo generally made uſe of, for the ſolving the Phaenomenas of Diſeaſes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe ſort of humors do not conſtitute the blood, but what are ſo called (except the Blood) are only the recrements of the blood, which ought continually to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from it: For in truth the Blood is an only humor; not one thing about the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, and another in the habit of the Body; nor is it moved at one time by Phlegm, and another time with Choler, or Melancholy, (as is commonly aſſerted) but the Liquor growing hot in the Veſſels, is only Blood, and whereſoever it is carried through all the parts of the Body, it is ſtill the ſame, and like it ſelf. But becauſe by reaſon of the abundance of the implanted heat in ſome, and becauſe of the ſmalneſs of it in others, the Coction of the Aliment is now quicker, now ſlower performed in the Bowels, and in the Veſſels; therefore the temper of the Blood (tho but one, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the ſame Liquor) becomes diverſe: and according to the various diſpoſition of this, it may be ſaid that men are Choleric; Melancholic, or of another temperament. Beſides, becauſe whilſt the Blood is made in its Circulation in the Veſſels, ſome parts continually grow Old, and others are ſupplied anew, hence from Crudity, or too much Coction, there is a neceſſity that what is excrementitious ſhould be heaped toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which notwithſtanding by its efferveſcency, (as by the working or depuration of Wines it comes to paſs) it is ſeparated from its Maſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the watry humor, fixed in the Bowels, or ſolid parts, is it which is called Phlegm: ſome Reliques of aduſt Salt and Sulphur, being ſeparated in the Liver, and received by the Choleduct Veſſels are called Choler; the Earthy feculences being laid up in the Spleen, are termed Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. In the mean time, the Blood if rightly purified ought to want Choler, Phlegm and Melancholy: even as when ſome Wines, or Beer are purified, the more light Particles are carried upwards, which conſtitute its Flowers or Head; and the dregs are preſt down to the bottom, which grow together into Feces or Tartar: yet none can truly ſay it, Wine or Beer is compoſed of Froth, Tartar, and a Vinous Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:107016:34"/>But as theſe humors, commonly ſo called, are made out of the other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>viz.</hi> Choler out of Salt and Sulphur, with an admixtion of Spirit and Water; and Melancholy, out of the ſame, with an addition of Earth; and as the blood is immediately forged out of theſe kind of Principles, and is wont to be reſolved ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into the ſame, I thought beſt, the common acception of humors being laid aſide, to bring into uſe theſe celebrated Principles of the Chymiſts, for the unfolding the Nature of the Blood and its affections. There are therefore in the blood as in all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, apt to be Fermented, very much of Water and Spirit, a mean of Salt and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and a little of Earth. The blood being looſned by putrefaction, exhibits the ſame ſeparated and diſtinct. Alſo in the blood contained in the Veſſels, or being freſh let out from them, we may diſcover their energies and effects: beſides when in the Food, whereby we are fed, by the juice of which the Liquor of the blood is made, theſe ſame are implanted, no man will go about to deny that the blood alſo is made from them: wherefore I will briefly run through theſe, and endeavour to ſhew by what means the Conſiſtency, the Properties, and the Affections of the Blood are made by them.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Spirits (which readily obtain the chief place) are a ſubtil, and greatly vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile portion of the blood. Their Particles, always expanſed, and endeavouring to fly away do move about the more thick little Bodies of the reſt, wherewith they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, and continually detein them in the motion of Fermentation. The Liquor of the blood, continually boils up with their efferveſcency or growing hot, and equal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion in the Veſſels, and the reſt of the Principles are contained in an orderly moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and within the bond of the exact mixture; if any Heterogeneous thing, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreable to the mixture, be poured into the bloody Maſs, preſently the Spirits being diſturbed in their motion rage, ſhake the blood, and force it to grow hugely hot, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til what is extraneous, and not miſſible, is either ſubdued, and reduced, or caſt out of doors. By the irradiation, or rather the irrigation or watering of theſe, the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Nerves are inflated, the Functions of the Viſcera, and alſo the Offices of motion, and ſenſation are performed: from the want of Spirits, alſo from their motion being depraved or hindred, ariſe great vices of the Natural oeconomy or Government. The more quick motion and efferveſcency of theſe in the blood, (above what is in Wine) chiefly depends upon the Ferment of the Heart; becauſe, whilſt the blood paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes through the Boſom of the Heart, its mixture is very much looſned, ſo that the Spirits, together with the Sulphureous Particles, being ſomwhat looſned, and as it were inkindled into a flame, leap forth, and are much expanded, and from thence they impart by their deflagration, a heat to the whole. By reaſon of this kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion, and ſuffuſion of heat, there is made a continual expence of Spirits, which being rarified, as it were inkindled, continually fly away, and are evaporated forth a doors: and as long as we live there is made a continual reparation of theſe by ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, chiefly the moſt delicate; which contain in themſelves very much of Spirit and ſwelling matter: from which juice being drawn by digeſtion, and collated to the blood, is aſſimilated to it and fills up its defects. When the Blood of Animals is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled, the Spirits (like <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi>) aſcend of a limpid colour, they are made very ſharp and pricking by the adheſion of the Salt; yet they are not ſo eaſily drawn off as the Spirits of Wine, but that there is need of a more intenſe fire to force them, becauſe they are hardly driven from the fellowſhip of the thicker parts, with which they are involved.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That there is plenty of Sulphur in the blood, it is plainly ſeen, becauſe we are chiefly fed with Fat and Sulphureous Aliments, alſo the Nutriment from the blood, carried to the ſolid parts, goes into Sulphur and Fatneſs. It is moſt likely, from the diſſolution of this, that the red Tincture of the Blood doth ariſe: for Sulphureous Bodies, before any others, impart to the ſolvent <hi>Menſtruum,</hi> a colour highly full of redneſs; and when by reaſon of too great Crudity, the Sulphur is leſs diſſolved, the blood becomes watery and pale, that it will ſcarce dye a Linnen ragg red. The Maſs of blood being impregnated with Sulphur, and together with Spirits, it becomes very Fermentable: which however, whilſt it enters the Ventricles of the Heart, there ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a greater efferveſcency, or rather accenſion; and on the Particles chiefly Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, being inflamed; and thence diffuſed through the whole, the lively and vital heat in us depends. When the Sulphureous part is carried forth, and doth too much lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uriate
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:107016:35"/>in the blood, it perverts its diſpoſition from its due ſtate, that therefore the blood being either depraved, or made more bilous or Cholerick, doth not rightly Cook the nouriſhing juice; or being inkindled throughout, it conceives heats and ardours ſuch as ariſe in a continual Feaver. For the Sulphur being too much exalted; and ſwelling more than it ought, ſtirs up great heats in the blood: and they whoſe-blood is more plentifully impregnated with Sulphur, are moſt obnoxious to Feavers. By reaſon of the Particles of this being incocted with the Nutritious juice, and from thence car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſolid parts, fatneſs, ſoftneſs and tenderneſs, come to out Body. From the Fleſh or Blood putrefying, by reaſon of the abundahce of evaporated Sulphur, a moſt evil ſtink breaths forth: In the diſtillation of Blood, Sulphur aſcends under the form of a blackiſh Oyl, which alſo by reaſon of the Empyreuma, ſtinks moſt wickedly.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That Salt is in the blood, is evinced by the Salt; which, tho fixed, is drawn forth, by being eaten, from Vegetables, and from other eatable things, at firſt leſs volatile, afterwards by the moſt excellent digeſtion of Nature, and Circulation, is highly volatiliſed; that it paſſes through, not only without a remaining <hi>Caput Mortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> all the members and parts of our Body, but alſo the blood being expoſed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillation, aſcends the alembic, and leaves the dead Head as inſipid earth: If at any time the Saline Particles are not rightly exalted in the Blood, by reaſon of ill digeſtion, but remain crude, and for the moſt part fixed, from thence the blood becomes thick and unfit for Circulation, ſo that obſtructions are begot in the bowels and ſolid parts, and ſerous Crudities are every where heaped together: But if the Salt be too much carried forth, and ſuffers a Flux, the Spirit being depreſſed, or deficient, a ſour and bitter diſpoſition is given to the blood, ſuch as is obſerved in Scorbutical people, and thoſe ſick of a Quartan Feaver. Alſo from the Salt, for this reaſon being vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly coagulated, the Stone, King-Evil, Gout, Leproſie, and very many other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes ariſe. But when Coction being rightly performed in the bowels and Veſſels, the Salt is duly exalted, and being aſſociated with the Spirit, is volatiliſed, then by reaſon of its mixture, the Liquor of the blood more equally ferments; alſo is defended from Putrefaction, Stagnation and Coagulation: Alſo the Saline Particles, bridle the fierceneſſes of the Spirits, and eſpecially of Sulphur; wherefore, thoſe who have their blood well filled with a Volatile Salt, are leſs obnoxious to Feavers: alſo hence thoſe who often are let blood, are more apt to Feavers.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Beſides, There are in the blood (as it is a thick humour, and hath a groſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence) many Earthy Particles: from hence alſo, its too great Volatiliſation is as it were ſupported, and its too haſty accenſion hindered: even as Charcoal-duſt, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded oftentimes to Gun-Powder in a greater proportion, that all its parts may not take fire at once, and too ſoon. Further, from the Terreſtrial Particles of the blood and Nutritious Juice, the bulk and increaſe of the Body proceeds. Laſtly from the diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, a light and friable <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> is left in great plenty.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Upon the watery part of the blood depends its fluidneſs; for from hence its ſtagnation is hindered, and the blood is circulated in the Veſſels, without growing thick or ſtiff: alſo its too great conflagration, and aduſtion is reſtrained, and its heat attempered. When blood is diſtilled a clear and inſipid water is drawn off, at leaſt in a double proportion to the reſt; for from hence the matter of Urine, Sweat, and every humid Excrement, for the moſt part proceeds.</p>
                     <p>What things were but now aſſerted, concerning the Principles of the blood, and the affections to be deduced thence, will better appear, if we conſider conſider a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the blood according to its ſenſible parts, and ſhall comkpare it with other Liquors which are in dayly uſe among us. Thoſe ſort of Liquors, which have a very great Analogy with the blood, are <hi>v.z.</hi> Rich Wine and Milk. As to the reaſons of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation and growing Hot, it is moſt fitly compared to Wine, as to its conſiſtency, coagulation, and departure of the paits one from another, it is likened to Milk.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, it is obſerved of Wine, that ſo long as it is ſhut up in the Veſſel or Pipe, its ſubtil and ſpirituous Particles, do perpetually agitate, or very much ſhake others more thick, break them, and render them fit for an exact mixtion; what is heterogeneous, and unfit for ſubaction or mingling, is ſeparated by its grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot: In the mean time the purified Liquor greatly fermenting is in perpetual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:107016:35"/>whereby all the parts (as Atoms variouſly moved up and down, in a beam or ſtreak of light) do ſtretch themſelves forth onevery-ſide, and contend with a conſtant rowling about, from top to bottom, and from thence to the top again. By the attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and refraction of the Particles very many <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Atoms, go away from the Liquor, which if the Veſſel being cloſely ſhut, they are kept within; the Liquor grows too exceſſively hot, and oftentimes cauſes the containing Veſſel to burſt in picecs. Blood, much after the ſame manner being ſhut up within the Veins and the Arteries, is urged with a conſtant Circulation: The Vital Spirit makes ſubtil, breaks, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly molds the more thick Particles; what is heterogeneous, and not mixable, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels forth of doors; in the mean time by the refraction and kneading of the parts, <hi>Effluvia</hi> of heat do conſtantly ſtream forth, and evaporate through the pores; which being ſhut in, if tranſpiration be hindred, preſently by reaſon of the too great boyling of the blood a Feaver is inkindled.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we will obſerve concerning Wines, that they grow turgid, or ſwell up, if any extraneous thing, and of a Fermentative Nature, be poured to them; yea ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, that they are moved more than ordinary of their own accord. For, when by a long digeſtion, the Sulphureous part of the Wine is too much exalted, it conceives a greater heat than it ought, and (unleſs preſently appeaſed) perverts the diſpoſition of the whole Liquor, with its ſwelling up. It ſeems to be for the very like reaſon, that the Feaveriſh heat which is wont to be introduced by reaſon of the ſame Cauſes, is ſtirred up in the blood, as ſhall be ſhown in the next Chapter, where we treat of the Motion and Heat of the blood.</p>
                     <p>The third Obſervation, or comparing of the Blood with Wine, ſhall be of this ſort: Wines (as alſo many other Liquors, as for example, Beer, or Sider) have their times of crudity, matruation, and defection. For when they are firſt made, the Spirituous parts are ſo obvolved by the others more thick, that they ſhew themſelves but little, and put forth almoſt nothing of ſtrength or virtue: and as the other Particles, are not yet ſubtiliſed, nor truly concocted, the whole Liquor remains crude, and of an ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful taſt, and if put to diſtillation, not any Spirit aſcends. From this ſtate it comes by degrees to perfection, and when the Spirits being extricated from their intangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, obtain their own right, and have ſubtilized and exalted the more thick Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the reſt, the whole maſs of the Liquor becomes Clear, Spirituous, Sweet and Balſamick. Laſtly, when by a long Fermentation, the Spirits are conſumed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin at length to fail, the ſtate of defection is induced, whereby Wines, and other Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, either paſs into a taſtleſneſs, or at laſt the Salt and the Sulphur being too much exalted, are made ſowt or unſavory. In like manner the blood alſo, while it is Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the Veſſels, may be conſidered according to this kind of threefold diſpoſition: Firſt, in the making or crudity, which has relation to the Chyme new made in the <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and freſhly poured to the blood; the Particles of which, like to unripe Fruit, are crude and undigeſted. Secondly, In the perſect ſtate or maturation, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the blood being ſufficiently wrought, and made Volatile, according to all its Particles after it is inſpired by Ferments, and its inkindling in the heart exalted. Thirdly, in its defection, which reſpects the blood; after it hath burned forth, and its Spirituous parts are very much flown away, and the reſt growing old and poor, have need to be removed; and ſo they are either the Reliques of Salt, which are with the <hi>Serum</hi> ſtrained forth continually by the Urine; or they are Particles of Salt and Sulphur, boyled and baked together, which are ſtrained forth by the virtue of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver into the choleduct Veſſels: or laſtly, they are dregs and earthy recrements of the blood it ſelf, which are carried into the Spleen, and there (as it were a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> exalted by a new digeſtion) go into a Ferment, at length to be tranſmitted to the blood. Whilſt after this manner, the generation of the blood, and its due maturation are truly diſpatched, it is pleaſingly circulated within the Veſſels, neither wanting in motion or heat nor inordinately troubled with them. But if either the ſupplement of the nouriſhing Juice, be not made agreeable with the reſt of the blood, nor aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, but that either by reaſon of the defect of Concoction, it is waſhed into a very crude humor, or becauſe of its exceſs, it is roſted into a burnt matter; or if the blood growing old, does not lay aſide what it caſts off, and give way to a new Nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humor; I ſay, by reaſon of theſe kind of Vices, concerning Sanguification, or the making of blood, the blood is variouſly perverted from its due temper and equal motion, and now becomes Watery and Cold; now Sharp of Salt; now Acid, Auſtere, or by ſome other way degenerate, and ſomtimes obnoxious to ſtagnations, and ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes alſo to immoderate heats.</p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:107016:36"/>
                     <p>We may obſerve theſe kind of degrees of crudity, coction, and defection, in the blood, both of the ſound and of the ſick: in healthful perſons after a more plentiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, Surfeit, or hard drinking, when too much of <hi>Serum</hi> or of Juice, is poured to the blood, its whole maſs being too much diluted with a crude humor, becomes more watery and leſs ſpirituous; wherefore men are rendered ſluggiſh, and unfit for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or exerciſe. In ſick perſons the Phlegmatic Conſtitution of the Body, induces ſuch a crudity of the bloody maſs, as is diſcerned in the White Dropſie, the Dropſie, <hi>Pica</hi> or longing Diſeaſe, and the <hi>Chloroſis</hi> or Green-ſickneſs. Alſo the ſtate of this kind of crudity, comes in an intermieting Feaver, and in truth is the cauſe of the Feaveriſh acceſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the dyſcraſie of the blood; the nouriſhing Juice being heaped up, is not aſſimilated to it, but for the moſt part goes into a crude, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe degenerate matter; with which, when the maſs of the blood is filled to a pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſwelling up it brings on the fit.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of Maturation, Concoction being finiſhed, happens in healthful perſons, ſome hours after Eating, eſpecially in the morning, to wit, when the ſupplement of the Chyme, is ſpiritualiſed, and as it were enkindled in the whole, by reiterated Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations: for then men are made more nimble and lively, and more ready for ſtudies, or any buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of Defection, is in the blood of ſound men after faſting long, hard labor, and want of Food, for then the Vital Spirit being very much evaporated, the maſs of the blood begins to become as it were lifeleſs, wherefore they preſently languiſh, and are made weak. Moreover, the blood by a too long Coction is burned, and grows bilous, from whence thoſe accuſtomed to want Food, or faſting, for the moſt part be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſad and melancholic. Some Diſeaſes habitually induce ſuch a diſpoſition of the blood; ſuch are the Scruvy, the Yellow Jaundies, the Cachexia (or evil ſtate of the Body when the nouriſhing Juice turns to ill humours) long Feavers, and moſt Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Diſeaſes, in which, the whole maſs of blood, paſſes from from a Spirituous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either a ſowr, ſharp, or auſtere Nature.</p>

                     <p>It is ſufficient that we have hitherto drawn a parallel of the blood, from which compariſon with Wine and Milk, may be gathered what ſort of Particles and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it comprehends in it ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirituous, and very agil or nimble, (ſuch as generous or rich Wine has) for the heat and motion; and beſides ſoft and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der (ſuch as are in Milk) for the nouriſhment of the Body. Yea alſo, this Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of it with Wine and Milk, is yet further confirmed by the uſe of them in our diet, out of which the blood is generated; foraſmuch as Milk is the beſt and moſt ſimple Aliment, and with it Infants, and Children, who have need of a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proviſion of blood are nouriſhed chiefly: But Wine copiouſly begets vital Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits before all other things, and being weak and fallen, excellently reſtores them, wherefore it is wont to be eſteemed inſtead of Nectar for old men, or thoſe of ripe years.</p>
                     <p>The Nature and Analyſis of the blood flowing within the Veſſels, being opened af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner, the Nutritious Juice deſwrves yet our conſideration, being ſupplyed from the blood, and ſeparated out of the maſs of blood, for the nouriſhment of the ſolid parts, and cleaving to them (whereby it may be the better aſſimilated) like Dew. For the Nerves, Tendons, and the reſt of the ſolid parts of the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, are waſhed with a certain alible juice. The Vital Spirits, having obtained the Nervous Bodies for a Vehicle of this, blow them forth at length, and expeditiouſly execute the actions of Senſe: alſo that humor coming upon the ſolid parts, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated with them, inlarges their bulk and growth. This is not a place to inquire after the Origine, Birth, and manner of the diſpenſation of this: If ſhall ſuffice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we have noted, that it is ſupplyed from the maſs of blood, and (as it is rendered highly probable by the moſt Learned Doctor <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Wharton,</hi>) after it hath paſt through the Nervous part by a certain Circulation, what remains, being now made as it were poor, and lifeleſs, is ſent back by the Lymphatic Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, to the blood.

                     <p>SO much for the anatomy of the Blood, as to its primary Elements and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutive parts, into which it is ſenſibly wont to be reſolved; alſo as to its Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which appear clearly, by the comparing it with Wine and Milk: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us next to enquire concerning the motion of the Blood, both Natural, (<hi>viz.</hi> by the help of what Ferment, and by what ſwelling up of parts, it is Circulated in a perpetual motion through the Veſſels) and preternatural, <hi>viz.</hi> for what Cauſes, and what fury of parts, when it boils up above meaſure in the Veſſels, and conceives Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Efferveſcences. Theſe being rightly unfolded and premiſed, we will enter upon the Doctrine of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Natural Motion of the Blood, we ſhall not here enquire of its Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, <hi>viz,</hi> by what Structure of the Heart and Veſſels, it is wheeled about after a conſtant manner, as it were in a water Engine; but of its Fermentation, <hi>viz.</hi> by what mixtion of parts, and mutual action of them together among themſelves (like Wine fermenting in the Ton) it continually boils up. And this kind of motion, (as it were truly an inteſtine war of the blood) depends both on the Heterogenety of the parts of the blood it ſelf, and on the various Ferments, which are breathed into the maſs of the blood from the Bowels.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt: thoſe things which have altogether like Particles do not ferment, wherefore, neither diſtilled waters, Chymical Oils, Spirits of Wine, or other ſimple Liquors are moved, as hath been already obſerved: but I have ſaid, that Blood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature things quickly irritable, doth conſiſt of a proportionate mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Elements; in which Spirits, for that they are very nimble, continually ſtrive to expand themſelves and to fly away: but being intangled by the more thick Particles of the reſt, they are detained in their flight. And being detained after this manner, they toſs about, break to pieces, and very much ſubtiliſe the more thick lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Bodies, by which they are hindered; they volatiliſe the Salt, otherwiſe fixed; by a moſt minute kneading, and by the adheſion of it, they perfectly diſſolve the Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, compacted in it ſelf, and not miſcible with the reſt, and boil it in the <hi>Serum.</hi> They break the Earth, even to its ſmalleſt parts, and mingle it with the reſt. But in the mean time, by the ſtriking and molding the Salt and the Sulphur, <hi>Effluvia's</hi> of heat plentifully proceed, which being mixed with the reſt, and on every ſide diffuſed, increaſe the motion of the Fermentation. And after this manner all being moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely broken and diluted with watery Particles, they conſtitute the Liquor of the Blood: which, whilſt in the Veſſels, as Wine ſhut up in a Pipe, continually ferments, and, according to all its Particles is in perpetual motion.</p>
                     <p>But the Fermentation of Wine, and of Blood, differs in this: that in Wine there is no waſting of the old parts, and a coming again of new; but the Liquor being ſhut up in the Veſſel, remains ſtill the ſame: but 'its otherwiſe in Blood, in which ſome parts are continually deſtroyed, and in their place others are always generated anew. In Wine, the times of crudity, maturation, and defection, are diſtinct, and are ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively performed in the whole; In Blood, that threefold ſtate is celebrated at the ſame time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> parts: Fermentation being once begun in Wine, is continued even to the end, but In Blood, becauſe it is waſhed ſtill with crude Juices, it ought ſtill to be renewed; by which means, the Nutritious Particles, not of kin, are aſſimilated to the reſt of the Latex; wherefore, for this work, beſides the Fermentation once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the blood, there is need of ſome Ferments, which may continue the ſame, otherwiſe about to leave off.</p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:107016:39"/>
                     <p>That Ferments are required for the making of Blood, this is an Argument; that when they are wanting by Nature, they are with good ſucceſs ſupplyed by the work of Art: for fixed Salts, <hi>Alcaly</hi> Salt, Extracts, Digeſtives, Openers, and eſpecially Chalybeate Remedies, help for this reaſon, that, as it were by a certain Ferment, they reſtore anew, the weak, or almoſt extinct Ebullition or Boiling of the Blood.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the Natural Ferments, very many may certainly be formed, and in divers parts, or hid in the Bowels: for any humor, in which the Particles of Salt, Sulphur or Spirit, being much exalted, are contained, puts on the Nature of a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: after this manner, the flowring or dregs of Beer or new Wine, being kneaded with Meal, and the maſs kept to a ſowrneſs, come under this rank, by which new Beer, and the like Liquors, as alſo the maſs of Bread, are moſt excellently Fermented. In like manner in the Ventricle, a ſowriſh humour participating of exalted Salt, there helps concoction: and in the Spleen, the feculencies of the Blood from Salt and Earth being exalted, go into a Ferment.</p>
                     <p>How much vigor comes to the Blood from the Womb and Genital parts appears from hence, becauſe by the privation, or evil diſpoſition of them, follow, in Maids the Green ſickneſs, in men, barrenneſs or loſs of virility, want of Beard, and a ſhrill voice. But the chief Ferment, that ſerves for ſanguification, is eſtabliſhed in the Heart; for this is the chief fire-place, in which the cruder Particles of the Chyme, are as it were inkindled, and acquire a volatileneſs: which thing may be confirmed by many reaſons, but eſpecially by its effects, which we ſuffer in the precordia, as often as the Blood ferments more or leſs than it ought to do: for when it is too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled in the Heart, it is agitated impetuouſly, as it were by fires put under it; the ſigns of whoſe immoderate Ebullition are, a deep pulſe and vehement, then almoſt an intolerable heat in the Precordia, with a vehement thirſt; on the other ſide, when the Fermentation of the blood is leſſened in the Heart, we are affected with an anhelous, and difficult reſpiration upon any motion; as may be perceived in the Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Cachexia, and Yellow Jaundice: the reaſon of which is, not becauſe the Lungs are ſtuffed, or filled full of a tough or clammy matter; but becauſe the blood doth not rightly ferment, in that Repoſitory of Fermentation; wherefore, being fallen into its Boſom, it is not preſently Rarified; nor doth it ſoon leap forth into the Lungs, but being apt to ſtagnate, and remain there, cauſes an oppreſſion of the Heart it ſelf; for the helping of which, frequent breathing is made, that the blood being let forth into the Lungs, ſuccour might be brought to it: but if by motion or exerciſe, the blood be more provoked into its Ventricle, than can be derived by reſpiration, or the pulſe, into the Pneumonic Veſſels, there is danger of choaking. The like happens in thoſe that are dying: when the pulſe is very ſmall, and the blood being heaped up in the Heart for want of Fermentation, begins to ſtagnate and to clodder, we then breath deeply, with a noiſe and elevation of the breaſt; to wit, the blood with the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate endeavour of Nature, and the whole force of the Lungs, as long as it is able to be done, is emptied forth into the Lungs, leſt reſiding in the Heart, it ſhould wholly choak it.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, Motion and Heat, in the Blood, depend chiefly on two things, <hi>viz.</hi> partly on its own proper diſpoſition and conſtitution, by which, it being forged very greatly with active Principles of Spirits, Salt, and Sulphur, of its own accord ſwells up, or grows turgid in the Veſſels, even as Wine in the Ton: and partly on the Ferment implan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Heart, which very much rarifies the Liquor paſſing through its Boſom, and makes it to leap forth with a frothy heat: that the blood, which is quietly inſtilled to the Heart through the Veins, running gently like a River, from thence leaping forth through the Arteries, (like a Torrent) with noiſe and rage, might be carried forward, to all the parts of the whole Body. By what means this is done, though it is not eaſie to explicate Mechanically, yet the manner, and ſome not improbable reaſon of this thing are delivered by moſt Learned men, <hi>Ent, Cartes,</hi> and other. They ſuppoſe indeed, as it were a fire to be ſet in the Chimny of the Heart, which preſently inkindles the blood infuſed through the Veins, (even as a flame put to Wine burns it) which being ſo inkindled, by its deflagration (like lightning) paſſes moſt ſwiftly through the Arteries: ſo that heat, a moſt rapid motion, and <hi>Effluvia</hi> ſent by Perſpiration, are wont to proceed from the accenſion of the blood in the Heart only. <hi>Hogelandus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, that there is a Ferment hid in the Boſom of the Heart, that compels the Liquor of the blood to boil up, and to grow hot, with heat, and a plentiful emiſſion of Soot, juſt like Spirit of Nitre, when it is poured on the Butter of Antimony: ſo that the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:107016:40"/>blood flowing in gently through the Veins, being forthwith Rarified into ſpume and vapour by the ſerment of the Heart, runs very impetuouſly through the paſſages of the Arteries. Tis almoſt the ſame thing, whether it be ſaid to be done, either by this, or by that way: for the alteration which the blood receives in the Heart, may be equally deduced from a flame, or a Nitrous Sulphureous ferment, there ſuppoſed to be placed. Becauſe, whilſt the blood ſlides into the Ventricles of the Heart, preſently the frame of the Liquor is looſned, and the active Particles, eſpecially the Spirituous and Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the bond of the mixture being broke, do leap forth from the reſt, and ſtrive to expand themſelves on every ſide; but being kept in by the Veſſels, and being forced together with the remaining Liquor, through the open paſſages of the Arteries, they ruſh with violence, and ſwelling up by the way they can find, and by that means, diffuſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> of heat, through the whole body: there is little difference, whether this expanſion of the Particles of the blood, and exertion into the liberty of motion, be ſaid to be done by Accenſion, or by Fermentation, foraſmuch as by either way, the frame of the blood may be ſo unlocked, that from thence the Particles of Spirit, Salt, and eſpecially of Sulphur, being incited into motion, (as it were by an inkindled fire) may impart heat to the whole Body.</p>
                     <p>But this Rarefaction, or Accenſion of the blood in the Heart, very much depends upon the diſpoſition and conſtitution of the blood it ſelf: for if its Liquor be rightly cocted, being made volatile, and (like rich Wine) brought to maturity, it then Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there after its due manner, whereby the ſoluted Particles of the Spirits and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, diffuſe an equal, and moderate heat to all parts. But if the blood, by reaſon of an ill manner of feeding, and want of Concoction, be crude and watry, then it is leſs inkindled in the Heart, and from thence follow a frigid intemperance of the whole, difficult breathing and wheeſing, with a weak pulſe, and languiſhing; as in Cache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical people, thoſe diſtempered with the Green Sickneſs, and ſuch as are about to die, may be perceived: but if the blood becomes too luxuriant, and apt to grow tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, by reaſon of plenty of Sulphur being carried forth, or of its <hi>Effluvia</hi> being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, or of eating hot things; either its Accenſion or Fermentation in the Heart, is very much in creaſed, ſo that from thence a Feaveriſh heat, and greater efferveſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies than uſual, are ſtirred up in the whole. This various Fermentation of the blood in the Heart, according to the various temper of the ſame, may be illuſtrated by the example of Wine: freſh Muſt, that is yet crude, though it be boiled, or put on the fire, will not burn; but this being purified and brought to maturity, is eaſily inkindled, but ſends forth a ſmall flame, and quickly out. The ſame at firſt growing hot, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe warmed, if inkindled, is greatly inflamed, and for the moſt part is conſumed by its burning.</p>
                     <p>Whilſt the Blood, after this manner being rarified, or inkindled in the Heart, and from thence growing hot, through the paſſages of the Veſſels, is reſolved into minute parts, ſome little bodies depart from its looſned frame, which refuſe at laſt to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and fitted with the reſt of the Liquor: but theſe are of a twofold Nature; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thin, which like ſmoke form the burning fire, or <hi>Effluvia</hi> from a Fermenting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, do evaporate from the Liquor of the Blood, by a conſtant Diaphoreſis, through the breathing holes of the Body; or more thick, which like aſhes left after burning or the ſettling dregs after Fermentation, ought to be ſoon ſtrained from the maſs of Blood, and to be carried forth of doors: for otherwiſe, by their confuſion, they produce notable perturbations in the Blood. Whereby the Blood growing more hot, is diſſolved in the Heart, therefore theſe recrements, both Fuliginous and Earthy, are more plentifully heaped together; and when by reaſon of too great congeſtion, they cannot be preſently ſubdued and ſecluded from the maſs of Blood, they bring forth a ſwelling up of the Blood and Feaveriſh Heats.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Motion, Heat, and Natural Fermentation of the Blood, in the equal tenor of which, the means of our Health conſiſts, what hath hitherto been ſpoken, ſhall ſuffice. We will treat a little more largely of the preternatural, or too great efferveſcency, on which the types, and Paroxyſms of Feavers depend: I call that too much, or Preternatural Fermentation, when the Blood, (like a Pot boiling over the fire) grows hot above meaſure, and being rarified with a ſwelling ſpume, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtends the Veſſels, excites a more quick pulſe, and like a Sulphureous Liquor having taken fire, diffuſes a burning heat on every ſied.</p>
                     <p>This kind of motion or Fermentation of the Blood, will be beſt of all illuſtrated by an example of Wines growing hot. For Wines, beſides the gentle and equal Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:107016:40"/>by which they are at firſt purified, at ſome times do ſo remarkably grow hot, and boil up, that they fly out of the mouth of the Veſſel, and if they are cloſely ſtopped up, cauſe it to burſt in pieces. After this manner, as if ſtruck with fury, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they are immediately drawn away from the Tartar; or their Lees into another Veſſel, they will not ceaſe from growing hot, until the Spirit being very much looſned, and the Sulphur or Salt too much exalted, they are either made unſavory, or degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into a ſowrneſs.</p>
                     <p>Such an Efferveſcency in wont to be ſtirred up for two cauſes chiefly: Firſt, When any extraneous thing, and not miſcible, is poured into the Ton, (ſo ſome drops of Tallow, or Fat, being dropped into the Cask, will produce this motion) or ſecondly, when Wines being enriched with too rich a Lee or Tartar (by reaſon of the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts being above meaſure exalted) conceive heats of their own accord, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly boil up. For in whatſoever ſubſtance Sulphur abounds, and its Particles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing looſned from the mixture, conſociate together, and are bound cloſe in one, there ſuch immoderate heats are procured.</p>
                     <p>After a like (tho not wholly the ſame) manner, whereby Wines grow hot, the boiling up of the Blood is induced, to wit, either what is forein, and not akin to the Blood, is mixed with it, that when it is not aſſimilated, is wont to cauſe a Perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and growing hot, until that Heterogeneous thing, is either ſubdued or caſt forth of doors; and the Particles of the Blood being confuſed and troubled, are at laſt ſhaken forth, and that they get again their former place and poſition in the mixture. Or, Secondly, the Blood grows hot above meaſure, becauſe ſome Principle, or its conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutive Element, (<hi>viz.</hi> Spirit or Sulphur) is carried forth beyond its Natural temper, and becomes enraged; whereby indeed the Particles of this or that, being not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the reſt, are looſned from the mixture; being looſned, they become more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than they ought, ſhake much the Liquor of the Blood, and bring forth a heat, which is not allayed, till the Blood being as it were inflamed, burns forth with the long fire of a Feaver. By either way, whether the Blood grows hot in the Veſſels, by reaſon of the pouring in of a thing not miſcible, or by reaſon of the rage of the Spirit, or Sulphur being carried forth, becauſe from thence its frame is more looſned, therefore it is more inkindled in the Heart; and the active Particles firſt looſned from the Ferment there implanted, do grow exceeding hot, leap forth from the mixture, and diſperſe on every ſide by their motion, a ſtrong heat, and as it were fiery: but yet with this difference, that the Effervency, which depends upon the mingling of ſome extraneous thing with the Blood, is for the moſt part ſhort, or renewed, which, when what was Heterogeneous is ſeparated or ſubdued, is quieted of its own accord, and the ſhaken parts of the Blood, and put out of order, caſily return to their Natural ſite and diſpoſition. But the Ebullition which ariſes from the inordination of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit or Sulphur being enraged, is continual; to wit, here the whole maſs of the Blood is ſo looſned, and diſſolved from the ſtrict bond of the mixture, that as an Olly Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor having taken fire, it ceaſes not to grow hot, or to be inflamed, till the Particles of Spirit, or Sulphur, or the Combuſtible matter, be for the moſt part burnt out.</p>
                     <p>There remains yet a third manner of Preternatural Fervency, whereby the Blood is ſubject to alteration, which happens not to Wine, but moſt often to Milk; <hi>viz.</hi> when at any time, from a Morbific cauſe, a coagulation of its Liquor is induced, ſo that its ſubſtance is poured forth, and goes into parts, and there is a ſeparation made of the thick and earthy from the thin; by which means the Blood is not fitly circulated in the Veſſels, but that its congealed portions, being apt to be fixed in the extream parts, or to ſtand ſtill in the Heart, do interrupt the equal motion, or grievouſly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: For the ſake of the reſtoring of which Effervency, greater are wont to be ſtirred up in the Blood, to wit, ſuch as happen ordinarily in a Pluriſie, the Plague, Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, or the Venereal Diſeaſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Intermitting Feavers or Agues.</head>
                     <p>BY the Premiſes which we have ſpoken of already, concerning the Anatomy, Motion, and Heats of the Blood, there now lies open an eaſie paſſage to the handling of Feavers. The Notions which are commonly ſet forth, concerning a Feaver, out of the force and Etymology of the word, I here purpoſely omit: It may be deſcribed after this manner, that it is, An inordinate motion of the Blood, and a too great Heat of it, with burning and thirſt, and other Symptoms beſides, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Natural oeconomy or Government, is variouſly diſturbed. As we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked already, conceming the growing hot of the Blood, ſo now we do of a Feaver, that indeed, its acceſſion is either ſhort, and by fits, which is therefore termed Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting; or elſe great, and long protracted, which is called a continual Feaver. We will firſt ſpeak of the Intermitting Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Tho an Intermitting Feaver, in our Popular Idiom, is known by a proper Name, and is diſtinguiſhed contrary to a Feaver commonly taken, yet becauſe it hath too great Effervency of the Blood joyned to it, it is to be called a Feaver. It is peculiar to this, from a continual Feaver, that it hath certain remiſſions, or times of intermiſſion; that every fit begins with cold or ſhaking, for the moſt part, and ends in Sweat; that the acceſſions or coming of the fits, return at ſet Periods, and certain intervals of times, that a Clock is not more exact. Wherefore, we will firſt diſcourſe concerning this Feaver in general, what fort of heat of the Blood it is which continues its fit, and from whence it is raiſed up. Secondly, Wherefore the fit appears equally with cold and ſhaking, as with ſweat following. Thirdly, What may be the cauſe of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, as alſo of its certain ſet Periods. Fourthly and Laſtly, Are added ſome irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of Intermitting Feavers, as when now cold, now heat or ſweat is wanting; or when the Periods are wandring and uncertain, when the Remiſſion or ſpace of Intermiſſion, is not equal, but now comes ſooner, now later, and ſometimes redoubled: and I will endeavor to ſhew the reaſons of theſe: and of other Phenomena or appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which variouſly happen in this Diſtemper. Theſe being laid open, we will go on to unfold in the next Chapter, the diviſion of an Intermitting Feaver, and the kinds of it.</p>
                     <p>As to the firſt: The Effervency of the Bolld in an Intermitting Feaver, (or Ague) for the time of the fit, is as violent and ſtrong as in a continual Feaver: wherefore, it is concluded, that the parts of the Blood, among themſelves, or ſome Heterogeneous thing being mixed with it, do ſtrive together, and Ferment above meaſure. But there is required, that they may Ferment, or too greatly boil up among themſelves, that ſome Principle, as chiefly Spirit or Sulphur, being too much exalted and enraged, do appear above the reſt; which, when it cannot be yoaked with them, brings in a continual ſtrife and heat: but from this cauſe, a continual Feaver draws its riſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch an Ebullition of the Blood, being once begun, is not ſuddenly allayed, and when it is appeaſed, it does not afterwards preſently return. Wherefore for an Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Feaver, 'tis to be ſuppoſed, that ſome Heterogeneous thing is mingled with the Blood, whoſe Particles, when they are not aſſimilated, make ſo long an Ebulliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſame, till either being kneaded, they are rendered miſcible, or being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiliſed, are ſhut forth of doors. Wherefore, ſuch a matter being brought under, or ſhut forth of doors, the fit ceaſes, and when this matter ſprings again, it ſtirs up a new Ebullition, and ſo a new fit is brought on.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Matter, which being mixed with the Blood, induces the periodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Heats, and the other Symptoms of an Intermitting Feaver, 'tis very ambiguouſly, and diverſly diſputed among Phyſicians, where it is generated, in what ſeat or place it lodges, and by what means it ſo exactly obſerves, the times of its Motion, and Ebullition. But it would be a work of too much labour and tediouſneſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count here all the Arguments, of the Ancients, and Moderns, to reduce them into or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and to weigh their reaſons; Wherefore, doubting, I propoſe what has come into
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:107016:41"/>my mind, when I thought deeply of the matter, and ſubmit to the judgment of others.</p>
                     <p>Of neceſſity there is ſomthing, which brings in the Heat of the Blood exactly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodical, that is generated in our Body at the ſeveral periods, or acceſſions of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, always in a ſet meaſure, and equal proportion, and is communicated to the maſs of Blood; with which when the Blood is filled to a plenitade, it forthwith grows tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, and conceives an heat: But this is ſuppoſed to be either an Excrementitious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor, ſtiding down into ſome Mines, which by degrees, and at a ſet time, being brought to an increaſe, and moved, Ferments with the Blood: or it is the nutritious Juice, ſupplyed from the matter of Food, and delated in weight and meaſure, which, when it is not aſſimilated, by neaſon of a deſect in ſanguification, being heaped up to a fulneſs, for its own expulſion, induces a turgency in the Blood. The reaſon of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers, is commonly explicated by the former way, and the cauſes of the Intermiſſion, and ſet times of approach, are fetcht from the nature of the Humor, and the ſeat, or place where it is cheriſhed. The Neſt, or Mine of this Diſeaſe, almoſt by an unanimous conſent, is fixed on the firſt ſhop of the Body, and from hence the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Intermiſſion is fetched, and the continual difference of an Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: but they affirm the matter to be Choler, Phlegm, and Melancholy; and as theſe humors are ſaid to putrifie ſlower, or ſooner, ſo the Feaveriſh courſes, are ſaid to be abſolved, in the ſpace of the one or more days. But this Opinion, after the Circulation of the Blood hath been made plainly known to all, is deſervedly rejected. For when the Blood never ſtagnates in the Veſſels, but waſhes every place with a perpetual moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and continually carries away their filth, it is implſſible that the Mine of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe ſhould ſubſiſt in the Meſaraick Veins, where it is commonly aſſerted to be: as to what belongs to the cavities or dens, for the heaping up of the humors in the Viſcera, It ueither appears, by what means ſuch ſhould be formed without a Tumor or Impoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hume; nor by what inſtinct, ſuch humors, ſhut up in their Neſt, do increaſe, are conſumed, and laſtly ſpring forth again, at ſo exact intervals of times. Beſides, what is affirmed concerning Bile, Phlegm, and Melancholy, and of their periodical moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we hold wholly ſuſpected; becauſe theſe ſort of humors, are not afforded ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, ſuch as are deſcribed in the Schools: but the Blood, having gotten a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition, now being hotter, now colder, its nature imitates the qualities of ſuch humors; or in its Circulating, it lays aſide its Recrements, which being depoſited in little Cheſts or Veſſels, are falſely believed to be Morbific, and Preternatural humors. Wherefore, as the nutritious Juice, is the only humor wherewith the maſs of Blood is dayly refreſhed, and its ſupplements are made ſtill in meaſure, and proportion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, the periodical heats of the Blood, are to be drawn from the acceſſion and commixtion of this.</p>
                     <p>I have already remarked concerning the Particles of the Blood, a triple ſtate of crudity, maturation, and defection: to wit, the nouriſhing Juice, ſupplyed from the dayly Food, comes crude, is mixed with the Blood, and being for ſome time Circulated, is aſſimilated to is, and is ripened into a perfect humor: afterwards growing ſtale, it goes into parts and is laid aſide. Whilſt after this equal manner, the Blood is continually reſtored, and its loſſes repaired, it very quietly Ferments, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any trouble, or immoderate heat, and is circulated within the Veſſels; but if the ſupplement of the nouriſhing Juice, is not (as before) ripened, nor goes into Blood, by a perfect digeſtion, its Particles being confuſed with the Blood, remain as it were ſome Heterogeneous thing, and not exactly akin, in the maſs of Blood; with which, when it is filled to a plenitude, the Blood forthwith grows troubled, and conceives a Feaveriſh heat, whereby the freſh ſupply of this depraved Juice, is either overcome or caſt forth of doors. I ſay therefore, from the firſt inſtant, in which the nouriſhing Juice is not aſſimilated with the Blood, its Particles, tho mixed with it, are as yet Circulated with it, without any great tumult or perturbation, and ſo afterwards till the maſs of the Blood is filled with them to a turgency: but then it quickly boils up, and conceives a heat: almoſt after the ſame manner, as new Beer put into Bottles, which, if they are cloſely ſtopped, that nothing may evaporate, is at firſt contained in thoſe Veſſels, without heat or force; afterwards when the <hi>Effluvia</hi> being ſtill reſtrained, the maſs of the Liquor ſwells up, notably Ferments, and by reaſon of the force of Fermentation, oftentimes makes the Bottles fly in pieces: alſo this happens at a ſet time, and in the ſpace of ſo many hours, as in an Intermitting Feaver, the Liquor ariſes to its height of turgeſcency.</p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:107016:42"/>
                     <p>There yet remains a difficulty, for what cauſe the nutritious Juice, being conſuſed with the Blood, is not aſſimilated, but degenerates into an heterogeneous, and Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative matter: I ſuppoſe this to be done, for the moſt part, not by the default of the Aliments, nor yet of the Bowels, but by the vice of the Blood it ſelf. For the Blood, even as Wine, ſomtimes paſſes from its native and genuine diſpoſition, into an acid, ſowr, or auſtere diſpoſition; and becauſe the Blood makes Blood, it comes to paſs, that when it is departed from its due temper, it eaſily perverts the proviſion of the nutritious Juice, by which it ſhould be repaired. What that diſpoſition of the Blood is, and by what means contracted, ſhall be told hereafter, when we ſpeak of the kinds of Intermitting Feavers, and of their evident, and Procatarctick cauſes. The Heat, or Efferveſcency therefore of the Blood, which conſtitutes the fit of an Intermitting Feaver, depends only upon the aſſimilation of the nouriſhing Juice being hindered; the Particles of this being commixed with the Blood, are not (as before) ripened, nor are made into perfect Blood; but by the mixture of theſe, the maſs of Blood (as it were new drink) is imbued with little Bodies greatly Fermentative; when the which are more thickly heaped together, and the Blood is filled with them to a ſwelling up, it preſently grows hot, and a mighty agitation, and ſtrife of the Particles is made, by which, they break, and ſubtiliſe one another, till at length the vital Spirit getting the dominion, and the reſt being brought under, what is extraneous is thruſt forth of doors, from the company of which, the Blood being freed, the remiſſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion of the aguiſh fit follows; but afterwards from a new ſupply of this Juice, a new fit is brought on.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to the ſhaking, or cold preceding the heat, in this Diſtemper, I ſay, when the Particles of the nouriſhing Juice, do proceed from a ſtate of crudity, towards maturity, but do not attain it, they contract a notable ſowriſhneſs, with which they greatly prick, and haule the nervous parts, and cauſe the ſenſe of cold: even as new Beer, which being ſtopped cloſe in Bottles, paſſes from a ſweet into an acid and nitrous taſt, that for the cuttingneſs and cold, can ſcarce be ſwallowed. When therefore, the Particles of this ſort of crude Juice, being indued with a Nitrous ſowrneſs, do fill the maſs of the Blood to a fulneſs, or to a ſwelling up, and when they being more thickly heaped together, begin to enter into a Flux, they firſt of all ſtrike down the Vital Spirits, with their ſharpneſs, and ſomwhat overthrow their heat; wherefore the Blood Becomes colder, and is more ſlowly circulated: yea, and by reaſon of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of heat, the ſenſe of cold is perceived in the whole Body, and a pulſe very rare exiſts. Moreover, when the nervous and ſolid parts, are watered with this ſort of acetous Juice, for their laſt nouriſhment, by the Flux of this, which happens to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the turgeſcency of the Blood, theſe ſenſible parts are pulled, and irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into Tremblings and Convulſions. And this without doubt is the true and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine cauſe of the cold and ſhaking, which are excited in a fit of the intermitting Feaver; to wit, the Flux, and ſwelling up of the nouriſhing Juice, degenerated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Nitrous matter, with which the Spirits and heat being ſuffuſed, are blunted, and the Nervous Bodies being provoked, are moved into tremblings. But afterwards, when theſe Nitrous Particles being thruſt forth, from ſome part, into the Superficies of the Body, the Blood is ſomwhat freed from their weight and oppreſſion, the Vital Spirits recollect themſelves, and begin to ſhine forth; but from thence a moſt intenſe heat ſucceeds, becauſe, both the maſs of Blood, by reaſon of the growing hot with the Feaveriſh matter, being looſened, and alſo its mixture being laxed, the Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Particles are more plentifully inkindled in the Heart; and becauſe (the pores of the skin, being poſſeſſed by the ſame matter, thruſt forth towards the circumference of the Body) the vaporous <hi>Effluvia</hi> are reſtrained within, which do more ſhake, and make hot the Blood, that heat perſiſts ſtill in the Blood, until that Fermentative matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly burnt out, and together with the aduſt recrements, remaining after the burning, being fully brought under, and ſubtiliſed, and involved with the <hi>Serum,</hi> inſenſibly evaporates by ſweat, or tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Theſe things being premiſed, it will not be hard to ſhew the reaſons and cauſes of the intermiſſion, as alſo of the ſet periods, <hi>viz.</hi> the intermiſſion follows, becauſe all the Morbific matter is diſperſed in one fit, and ſo till new be ſubſtituted, there is a neceſſity that a remiſſion follow. But new matter begins to be begot, of which the laſt fit failed, to wit, the maſs of Blood being but now emptied, receives the nouriſhing Juice, and perverts it (as before) by reaſon of its defect of due making of Blood, and of Concoction, into a Fermentative matter; but its little plenty, ſtirs up little or no
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:107016:42"/>trouble, or Fermentation; but when the Blood is filled to a ſwelling up, it preſently ferments, and is in Flux, even as when new Beer, or new Wine, ſhut up a long while in a Veſſel, at length, at a certain time, boils up, and leapes forth at the mouth of the Veſſel.</p>
                     <p>But that the Fits, or Acceſſions, do for the moſt part come again, at ſet intervals of times, and that ſo certainly, that a Clock is not more exact; the reaſon is, becauſe the nouriſhable Juice, is for the moſt part ſupplyed from the Viſcera, to the Blood flowing in the Veſſels, in an equal meaſure and manner; for tho we do not dayly take exactly, ſo much meat and drink in weight and dimenſion, yet, becauſe we for the moſt part eat at ſet hours, for the ſatisfying the Appetite, from the things eaten, and the maſs of the Chyme heaped up in the Bowels, an equal portion of the nutritious Juice is conveyed to the Blood through the Milky Veſſels: wherefore, if at ſuch hours, ſo much of the nutritious humor is poured into the Blood, which increaſing to a fulneſs, and ſwelling up, it brings on the fit that day: certainly, this being finiſhed; in the ſpace of the ſame time, ſufficient matter is laid up, for the following fit: But if errors in feeding be committed, and that the ſick indulging their Appetite, eat more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or inordinately, the approach of the fit anticipates the wonted hour, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Bloods being filled ſooner with the Feaveriſh matter; if that the ſick are abſtemious, and more ſparingly take their Food, the intermiſſion is drawn out longer.</p>
                     <p>If it be yet asked. wherefore the periods of intermitting Feavers, be not of one kind, and of the ſame diſtance, but that ſome repeat or come again dayly, others on the third or fourth day? The cauſe is the diverſe conſtitution of the Blood, to wit, whereby it is perverted from its due temper, now into a ſouriſh, now into an acid or ſharp, or into an auſtere or harſh diſpoſition. By reaſon of the diverſe evil conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, the alible Juice, being freſh carried, departs more or leſs from maturati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is perverted into matter, apt ſooner or later to ferment. When the Blood has acquired a ſour, hot, and bilous diſpoſition, I ſuppoſe that ſome part of the nouriſhing Juice is ripened into perfect humor, and is aſſimilated with the Blood, and ſo goes into Food, to be carried to the ſolid parts, and is affixed to them; but the other part of it, from the Blood being too much cocted, and depraved, is changed into a Feaveriſh matter, and ſuppoſing, that half of the nutritious Juice is after this manner perverted, in double the time, in which it is ſaid to have a full Concoction in our Body, (that is after eight and forty hours) this kind of Fermentative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, riſes to a plenitude, and turgeſcency, and then induces the fit of a Tertian Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. If that, by reaſon of the auſtere, and pontic nature of the degenerated Blood, (in which a fixed Salt, with an Earthy <hi>Faces</hi> is exalted too much) and therefore apt to ferment more ſlowly, only a third part of the nutritious Juice is corrupted, then in three times the ſpace of the aforeſaid time, the fit is induced; that is, after ſeventy two hours, in which, the period of a Quartan, is wont to be concluded. But, if by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a greater infection of the Blood, almoſt the whole ſupplement of the nutriticus Juice is perverted into a Feaveriſh matter; then in the ſpace of that time, in which the plenary coction ought to be abſolved in the Veſſels and habit of the Body, (that is after twenty four hours) this matter ariſes up to the motion of turgeſcency, and brings on the Quotidian fit. And hence it comes to paſs, that in a Quartan Feaver, ſtrength and courage do not preſently fail, whilſt in a Tertian, the ſick are wont to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more weak; but in a Quotidian Feaver, they are ſooner brought into languiſhing, and greateſt weakneſs: to wit, in each, as more or leſs of the nutritious Juice goes into the Food of the Diſeaſe, ſo much alſo is drawn away, from the ſtrength and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Body. But more fully of theſe, when we treat of the ſeveral kinds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers, and the Cauſes of them.</p>
                     <p>Againſt the equal Circuits of theſe Feavers, it is argued: that for the moſt part, the fits do anticipate the ſet time of the day, by the ſpace of ſome hours, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo come after it. But in truth, this objection is taken away, if the times of intermiſſion be computed, not by days, but by hours; for ſo the intervals which but now ſeemed to be now ſooner, now longer protracted, will appear for the moſt part equal, by this Rule; foraſmuch as in reſpect of the day, it is ſaid a Tertian Feaver, ſomtimes prevents the wonted time of its acceſſion, two, three, or more hours, or comes after it; in the mean time, every circuit exactly repeats or comes again, every time, after ſo many hours. Wherefore the chief differences of Intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, conſiſt in this only, that the time of the acceſſion in one Feaver, comes more
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:107016:43"/>ſwiftly, and in another more ſlowly, <hi>viz.</hi> now at twenty four hours diſtance, now at thirty four, now at ſeventy or the like.</p>
                     <p>From what hath been ſaid, (unleſs I am deceived) it clearly appears, what the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcency of the Blood is, which conſtitutes the fit of an Intermitting Feaver, from whence the fore-runners of cold and ſhaking, and laſtly, what may be the reaſon of the intermiſſion, and of the ſet periods. But that theſe, and many other appearances of this diſtemper, depend upon the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, and becauſe of the depravation of the nutritious Juice, and not from humor, lurking in ſome mine, will yet more manifeſtly appear, from the collation of the ſigns and ſymptoms, which are to be met with, worthy of note, in this diſtemper: then ſecondly, from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catartic, or more remote cauſes being truly weighed, which are wont to induce this diſtemper: and thirdly, and laſtly, from the ways of the Criſis, and Cures, by which this Diſeaſe, either ceaſes of its own accord, or is driven away, by the help of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Among the Signs, the Pulſe and Urine, deſerve the chief conſideration: The Pulſe, the cold fit coming on, is very rare, and low, which clearly argues, the Heat, and Vital Spirits in the Blood, to be as it were overwhelmed, by ſome crude matter, not eaſily combuſtible, juſt as a fire inkindled on the Hearth, and then co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with green wood, glows very ſlowly, and flames forth little, which afterwards, the crude humor being blown away, breaks forth into an open and very ſtrong flame: ſo alſo, the Blood, the crude matter, which is in Flux, being ſomthing overcome, or diſperſed, is very much inkindled; and what remains in the Blood is burnt up, when fermenting with the Particles of it, and induces a moſt violent heat, with thirſt; wherefore the Blood growing impetuouſly hot, is urged with a vehement, and moſt ſwift Pulſe: otherwiſe, it being too much heaped together in the Heart might cauſe the danger of choaking.</p>
                     <p>As to the Urine; that is imbued (eſpecially in a Tertian Feaver) with a deep colour, and as it were inflamed, alſo when the Contents are wanting; which ſeems to denote a ſcorching of the Blood, and too aduſt temper: moreover, in this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, different from others, the Urine, for the moſt part is ill, when the Patient is pretty well, and on the contrary; foraſmuch as all the time of the intermiſſion, it is at a great diſtance from its natural ſtate, it becomes filled with a red colour, and thick, being expoſed to the cold, and lays down a plentiful ſediment, like to Bole-Armoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack; which is of neceſſity to be ſo done, becauſe in the whole interval of the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Feaveriſh matter is circulated with the Blood, and there riſes to maturity, with a ſecret increaſe. But in the middle of the fit, when the heat, and burning are at the greateſt, the Urine is laudable, and comes more near to the natural, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fermentative matter, being ſent to the Circumference of the Body.</p>
                     <p>The ſymptoms preceding the fit, confirm the ſame thing; for many hours before the fit begins, a perturbation of the humors, and blood, is perceived; an Headach, Vertigo, ſparkling of the Eyes, unquiet Sleep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which plainly ſhew, the Blood firſt infected with the Fermenting matter, and the aſſault of the fit to be only ſo long deferred, until the maſs of the Blood is filled to a ſwelling up, with the ſame kind of matter: The fore-runners of the approach of the fit are, now a paleneſs at the ends of the Fingers, or Toes, or in the Nails, ſomtimes a Convulſion, or numneſs; now a coldneſs, and pain in the Loins and Thighs, and ſomtimes a ſhivering and trembling invade the whole Body, which clearly ſhew, the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, and alſo the thin Liquor in the Nervous parts, firſt to conceive the motion of Fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this Efferveſcency, not to be excited from any other fire-place, or mine. If it be objected, that the ſick are moſt often infeſted with Vomiting, about the time of the fit; from whence it may ſeem to be concluded, that the chiefeſt hurtful matter is eſtabliſhed in the Ventricle, and in the firſt paſſages, eſpecially, when this diſtemper is chiefly cured, by the timely taking of a Vomit; I confeſs, very great Vomitings are ſomtimes ſtirred up, in the fit of an intermitting Feaver; but this more often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens, becauſe in the Feaveriſh ſhivering, the membranes of the whole Body are pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; wherefore the Ventricle alſo, as it is a very Nervous part, is diſtempered with a Convulſion, and having from thence contracted a Spaſm, caſts forth upwards what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever lurks in its boſom. Beſides, if that the Choler-bearing Veſſels, ſwell up with Bile or Choler, by the ſame Convulſion alſo of the Viſcera, the Bile is preſſed forth into the Duodenum by the Galiſh paſſage, and is emptied into the Ventricle, and there, by its fierceneſs, provokes yet to more cruel Vomiting, wherefore for the moſt part,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:107016:43"/>the vomiting which is excited for this reaſon, follows the ſhaking only. But that the Choler was not in the Stomach before the fit troubled it, but only preſſed forth from the Choleduct paſſage, by the Spaſm and Convulſive motions of the Viſcera, and poured forth into the Ventricle, appears from hence, becauſe if a Vomit be given in the midſt of the interval, between the two fits, little or nothing of bilous matter will be drawn forth; beſides, this bitter humor is of that fierceneſs, that it cannot be long contained in the Ventricle, but preſently it will procure the pain of the Heart, and Vomiting. Beſides this ſort of Vomiting, excited in the ſhaking fit, ſomtimes a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting is provoked in the midſt of the burning fit, or in the ſweat, the cauſe of which is, the redundancy of the biliſh humor in the Blood; of which if there be greater plenty, than what diluted with <hi>Serum</hi> may be ſent forth by Sweat, a great part of it, whilſt the Blood is circulated about the creviſes of the Liver, is laid aſide in the Chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct Veſſels; which, when being filled to a diſtention, exonerate themſelves, and ſend away the Choler to the Inteſtines and Ventricle, and there a Convulſion being preſently ſtirred up, ſomtimes Vomiting is provoked, and ſomtimes the Belly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes looſe, and the Stools liquid. In this Year 1657. I obſerved very many affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted after this manner, for when after an hot and dry Summer, about the middle of Autumn, an Intermitting Feaver generally raged, the ſick were wont ſuddenly to grow very ill, in the middle of their hot fit, and ſomtimes alſo in their ſweating, and the Sweat being ſtruck in, to be taken with Swooning; but ſhortly after, when a Choleric Vomiting followed, they were eaſed.</p>
                     <p>Not only the ſigns and ſymptoms, but the Procatartic or more remote Cauſes of this Diſeaſe, clearly indicate, that it takes its riſe from the temper of the Blood being changed: becauſe Intermitting Feavers, are moſt frequent in the ſeaſon, and places, in which the Blood receives the greateſt alteration from the Air, <hi>viz.</hi> either in the Spring, when the vernal heat ſhutting out the Winters cold, cauſes the Blood, before benumed, and apt to be more ſlowly moved, to begin to flouriſh, and luxuriate in the Veſſels, and from thence, to get a bilous and hot temper: or in the Autumn, when the Blood being torrified, or roaſted by the Summers heat, and therefore its Spirits very much depreſſed, and Salt and Sulphur exalted, acquires now a ſharp and Choleric, now a binding and auſtere diſpoſition: wherefore, at this ſeaſon, Feavers, now Tertian, now Quartan, are frequent; beſides, in ſome places, there is that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Heaven, that on all men whatſoever, there comes either a Tertian or (more frequently) a Quartan Feaver; although in the firſt offices, where the Mine of the Diſeaſe is commonly believed to be lodged, there be no congeſtion of humors, by reaſon of an ill manner of living, or ſickly diſpoſition. Yea, they moſt eaſily fall into this Diſeaſe, who have their inwards firm and ſtrong, and who abound with a lively heat: on the contrary, thoſe who by reaſon of a weak Concoction, heap up Crudities in the firſt paſſages continually, that they are prone to the Dropſie, or Cachexia, remain free, for the moſt part, from this Diſtemper; to wit, the Blood being made more watery, (like Wine degenerated into a taſtleſs ſubſtance) is altogether unapt to be fermented.</p>
                     <p>No leſs, doth the Cure of Intermitting Feavers ſeem to prove this our Aſſertion, whether it be Natural and Critical, or Artificial, and performed by the help of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines. As to the firſt, Intermitting Feavers are wont to be terminated, after a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold manner. The firſt is, when from the fits themſelves, the temper of the Blood is altered, and oft times is reduced into its Natural diſpoſition. For when in every coming of the fit, very much of Sulphur, and aduſt Salt is burnt out, and exhaled by Sweat, the Liquor of the Blood, by that means, becomes more temperate, and leſs torrid: wherefore, oftentimes this Diſeaſe is cured, at ſix or ſeven periods, and of its own accord ceaſes: but if it be longer protracted, and that the Blood being ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what changed, from the ſharp and bilous temper, or diſpoſition, is not reſtored to its Natural temper, ſomtimes it degenerates into an Acid, Watery, and alſo Pontic or ſaltiſh temper, from whence a long Tertian Feaver paſſes into a Quotidian, or a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan; alſo oftentimes, becauſe the Blood is greatly depraved, by the long continuance of this Feaver, the Jaundies, or the Scurvy, or the Cachexia follow. The other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, whereby this Diſea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> is terminated, is, when the change of the Air, or the Country, brings a notable alteration of the Blood: for ſo Feavers begun at the times of the Equinoxes, are ended about the time of the Solſtices; alſo the ſick, traveling into another Region, often grow well.</p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:107016:44"/>
                     <p>As to the cure of it, by the Inſtitutions of the Medicines, it uſes to be done two ways, <hi>viz.</hi> Empirically, and Dogmatically; and in this Diſeaſe, Empirical remedies, ſought from Quack-ſalvers, and old Women, are more eſteemed, and oftentimes do more than the preſcriptions of Phyſicians, adminiſtred after the exact method of cureing.</p>
                     <p>Empirical Remedies, which are ſaid to cure Intermitting Feavers or Agues, are of that ſort, which drive away the approaching Fit, without any Evacuation: and are either taken inwardly, or are outwardly applyed, where the Pulſes chiefly beat, <hi>viz.</hi> For the moſt part, they are bound either to the region of the heart, or to the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wriſts, or to the ſoles of the feet; theſe ſometimes are ſo commonly known to help, that ſome have warranted the ſudden cure of this Diſeaſe, by theſe Remedies, under the pain of ſome Forfeiture: Wherefore it is worth our inquiry, how theſe operate, and by what way or means they ſtop the Feaveriſh acceſſions. It is clear, Firſt, that thoſe which are outwardly applyed, do immediatly impart force, and action to the Blood, and Spirits; and when they drive away the Fit, by preventing, without the Evacuation of humor, or any matter of neceſſity, the reaſon of this effect conſiſts only in this, that by the uſe of theſe ſort of Medicines, the turgeſcency or ſwelling up of the Blood, with the Feaveriſh matter, and Fermentation are ſtop'd; to wit, from the Medicine tyed about the Body, certain little Bodys, or Effluvia are communicated to the Blood, which do very much fix, and bind together the particles of it, or alſo, as it were precipitate them, by fuſing and ſhaking them; and by either way, the ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous growing hot of the Blood, is hindred: as when cold water is put into a boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Pot, or as when Vinegar, or Alum is flung into new and working Beer, preſently Fermentation ceaſes, and the Liquor acquires a new taſt, and conſiſtency, whereby it becomes fit to be drunk, as if it had been kept to ripen a long time. But that theſe Ague-ſtoppers do work after this manner, it is plainly ſeen, becauſe thoſe which are of principal note, do excell in a Styptic, and binding force, or elſe with a precipitating virtue; hence Sea-ſalt, Nitre, Sal-gemmae, the Juice of Plantan, Shepherds-burſe, any binding Herbs pounded with Vinegar, and the like, bound to the wriſts; the root of Yarrow, Tormentile, alſo Campher hung about the neck, are ſaid to take away this Diſeaſe: yea, thoſe alſo which are taken inwardly, are of the ſame rank; The Juice of Plantan, Red-roſe water, Alum, for that they fix, and conſtrain the Blood, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction of Piper, Sal Armoniac, or of Wormwood, Spirit of Vitrial, alſo a-ſudden paſſion of anger, or fear, forasmuch as they precipitate the Blood, by fuſing and ſhaking it, do oftentimes hinder the Agues approach: even as the Concuſſion, and ſhaking much, any Liquour, or the infuſion of aſtringent things into it, hinder its ſpontaneous Efferveſcency and rage. It is uſual with ſome Empiricks, for the cure of Agues, to tye a little knot in a Linnen rag, or a piece of Paper roled up, ſo ſtrickly to the wriſts, preſſing hard upon the beating of the Pulſe, that the circulation of the Blood is ſomewhat hindred, and by this means, the Aguiſh fit coming on, is driven away. Very many by this way, I have none to be moſt certainly cured of a tedious ſickneſs; the reaſon of which ſeems to be, that whilſt the Blood is hindred from its motion in any part, it grows more tumuluous in the other parts; and ſo, by this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation, ſtirred up in the whole Blood, the ſpontaneous Efferveſcency of the Liquor, being about to follow, is hindred. But that the Fit, by this, or ony other means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once hindred, does not afterwards eaſily return, the reaſon is; Becauſe, if this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, and depraved matter, be contained longer in the Blood, it is afterwards cocted, and in ſome meaſure ripened: and therefore the Blood does not (as before) altogether pervert, either this, or the proviſion coming to it anew, but begins to digeſt and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate it: beſides, when the Fit is once ſtop'd, its cuſtom is broke, by the inſtinct of which alone, Nature oftentimes repeats thoſe her Errors: for, as when it has once made a fault, it is wont more readily to do ill after the ſame way; ſo when it once omits its fault, it more eaſily accuſtoms it ſelf to do better.</p>
                     <p>The dogmatieal cure, is inſtituted for the moſt part, by Vomitory and Purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, alſo with the letting of Blood; with which the ſick are miſerably tormented, and the Diſeaſe ſeldom profligated or driven away; that deſervedly, this Diſtemper is called the ſhame of Phyſicians; but Tertian Feavers are ſometimes carried away by a Vomit given juſt before the coming of the Fit, which indeed happens (as I think) for the reaſon before mentioned. For I have ſaid, That the cauſe of a Tertian Feaver, is an evil diſpoſition of the Blood, whereby it paſſes into a ſour and bilous Nature; and therefore it doth not rightly aſſimilate the nutritious Juice brought to it, but changes
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:107016:44"/>it into a Fermentative matter; wherefore, if the Bile or Choler be copiouſly drawn forth of the Blood, that Cholerick and hot intemperance is very much taken away, and that Fermentative power ceaſes of it ſelf, But Emetick Medicines do chiefly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this, for if they operate ſtrongly, a Convulſion is not only brought to the bottom of the Ventricle, but alſo the <hi>Duodenum,</hi> with an inverſe motion, is drawn together to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Pylorus, and the Cholerby a continual thruſting forward, being ſquees'd forth from the Choleduct paſſage, is poured into the Ventricle, which is preſently caſt out by Vomit; which being copiouſly performed, the galiſh bladder is almoſt empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and after that, it becomes a receptacle, that draws forth, and ſeparates the bilous humor, or the particles of aduſt Sulphur and Salt plentifully poured into the Blood; the next Fit ſometimes is by this means prevented, not becauſe the mine of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is extirpated by Vomit, but becauſe an Evacuation and motion is excited, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Feaveriſh motion, and for that reaſon, the ſpontaneous Efferveſcency of the Blood is prevented. Alſo by this means, ſometimes the Diſeaſe is taken away af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fit, becauſe this way, the Blood is fully cleared from the bilous humor. It is worthy obſervation, that in a Quartan Feaver, Vomits profit nothing, and ſeldom in a Tertian, unleſs adminiſtred preſently at the beginning, whilſt the Feaveriſh diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is yet light, and not fully confirmed.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Intermitting Feavers in general, there yet remain ſome Irregulars of them, to be explicated, which vary from the wonted manner: for unleſs theſe unuſual appearances be ſolved, this our Hypotheſis will ſeem to be defective, and to halt in one part. Firſt therefore, they are wont ſomtimes to lack the cold or ſhaking fit. This Intermitting Feaver is frequent in Autumn, whoſe fits are wont to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the ſick, only with heat, and that moſt Violent, and in many they come with great Vomiting, but no Sweat or Cold; then after four or five periods, upon the coming on of the fit, the ſick are wont to be chil, and preſently after to quake, and in the declination to ſweat: The reaſon of this was, becauſe, from the very hot Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the Conſtitution of the Blood was become ſharp, and very much burnt: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the Particles of the crude Juice, being commixed with it, were preſently terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or made hot, and ſcorched; that they did not at firſt, (like new Beer) grow hot with an Acrimony, and then afterwards blaze forth; but a turgeſcency being ſtirred up, (like dry wood laid upon a fire) preſently the whole took fire, and broke forth into flames; but afterwards, the Liquor of the Blood being fired by ſeveral fits, became leſs torrid, that the depraved Alible Juice was not preſently torrified, but paſſed into a Nitrous matter, and fermenting with a ſharpneſs, which at firſt ſwelling up, induced the ſenſe of cold to the whole Body. When the cold fit was begun, for the moſt part Sweat concluded it: which indeed hapned, becauſe the Blood being made more watery, is more eaſily reſolved into vapour, with the Feaveriſh matter, even as a watery Liquor is more eaſily drawn forth by diſtillation, than what is Oily, or of a more thick conſiſtency.</p>
                     <p>It often happens, in the declination of this Diſeaſe, when the fits begin to leſſen, that the ſenſe of cold and ſhaking, by little and little are diminiſhed, and at length vaniſh, and the fit only troubles the ſick, with a light burning: The reaſon of which is, becauſe at this time, the Blood being ſomwhat reſtored, towards its natural ſtate, begins to concoct and ripen the crude juice; ſo that a great part of it is aſſimilated: but ſome Excrements, being heaped together in the Blood, bring forth as yet a light burning: but when the Feaveriſh Particles, do not participate of the Nitrous Acrimony, the Fermentation of the Blood is induced without any ſhivering, by which, what was extraneous burns forth, is either ſubdued, or carried forth of doors. Somtimes alſo, in the declination of this Diſeaſe, the fits appear without any burning, only with a light cold: The reaſon of which is, becauſe the Morbific matter, being rather Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous, than Sulphureous, when it is in Flux, does ſomwhat blunt the Natural Heat; and by that means is diſſipated, and vaniſhes, without any great deflagration.</p>
                     <p>There is yet a great doubt concerning the intervals of the periods, which ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeem to be double in the ſame Feaver, that the firſt Acceſſion anſwers to the third, and either perhaps comes in the morning; and again the ſecond to the fourth, and both happen in the Evening; and ſo forward: wherefore, the Feaver bearing this figure, is wont to be named a double Tertian, or Quartan, of which it doth not eaſily appear, how they ſhould be done, if the fits depend upon the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, and from thence on a Congeſtion to a Turgeſcency of the depraved Nouriſhing Juice: for which cauſe, they commonly affirm, that this double figure is
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:107016:45"/>ſtirred up, or draws its original from a double Neſt, or Mine; but to me it ſeems moſt likely, that in this caſe, ſomtimes it happens for the Feaver to be ſimple, and of one kind, alſo its types or figures to be alike, and all congruous one to another, but the error to ariſe, becauſe the interſtitia of the periods, are not computed by hours, but days: For when as, the beginnings of the fits are diſtant one from another, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly twenty four hours, but either ſixteen, or thirty hours, in a Quotidian; and in a Tertian, not forty eight, but forty, or fifty ſix, more or leſs, or thereabouts; it comes to paſs, that every other fits, happen before, and the others after Noon. To which alſo may be added, that the different manner of eating, which the ſick uſe, very often produces great inequalities of figures: that ſomtimes the fit is redoubled twice in a day, as I have often obſerved in Cachectical men, or full of ill humors, and living diſorderly: but it doth not ſeldom happen, that Intermitting Feavers, repeat fits, which do neither obſerve the ſame diſtance, nor bear altogether the figure of the ſame mode. I have many times obſerved in a Quartan Feaver, that beſides the ſet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings or Acceſſions, returning on the fourth day, about the ſame hour; ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring and uncertain fits, did infeſt the ſick; that ſomtimes on the day preceeding, the wonted fit, ſomtimes on that following it, another fit (tho lighter) was excited anew, with ſhivering, Heat, and Sweat, exactly like the figure of an Intermitting Feaver; and nevertheleſs, the primary Acceſſion returned at its accuſtomed time. This for the moſt part, is wont to happen, either from diet evilly inſtituted, chiefly from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit, and drinking of Wine; or elſe from Medicines wrongfully adminiſtred: The reaſon of which (unleſs I am deceived) conſiſts in this. The maſs of Blood, being wont to be filled to a ſwelling up, with the Fermentative matter, at a ſet time, often, by reaſon of ſome errors in eating and drinking, heaps up more matter, than can be eaſily diſſipated in one fit; and when it unequally Cooks the ſame Fermentative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it often happens, that it firſt ſhakes off its ſuperfluous, or more thin part, as it were by a certain skirmiſh, in a more light fit, but diſpels the more thick, (after the primary Acceſſion) as yet remaining in the Blood, by a Feaveriſh Fermentation ariſing anew. And when the fits, in an Intermitting Feaver, redouble after this manner, either become more remiſs, for that the ſame matter in either, is only divided; and eventilated by two acceſſions. Beſides, when this Fermentative matter, or Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice, depraved in its circulation, is continued, partly in the Arteries and Veins, with the Blood, and partly in the Nervous ſtock, and ſolid parts, it may happen, that both humors do not ferment at once, but a great part of one may be diſperſed in one fit, and then a great part of the other, in another fit.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the kinds of Intermitting Feavers, and firſt of a Tertian.</head>
                     <p>WE ſhall eaſily accommodate to our Hypotheſis, delivered in the former Chapter, concerning the nature and beginning of Intermitting Feavers, all the Phaenomena which belong to it, and the reaſons of them. But as thoſe which are of this ſort, do not obſerve the ſame ſpace of Intermiſſion, or of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, and their figures, as to the appearances of their ſigns and ſymptoms, do not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether happen after the ſame manner; therefore according to the diverſities of theſe, and eſpecially from the diſtance of the fits, the various ſpecies and differences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting Feavers, are aſſigned. The chiefeſt diviſion of them is, into Tertian, Quotidian, and Quartan: We ſhall here remark the chief things worthy of note concerning each of them.</p>
                     <p>It is called a Tertian Feaver, not which is accompliſhed at the diſtance of three days; but incluſively from the day in which one Fit begins, from thence the other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns on the third. In the mean time, if the Fits be ſometimes longer, <hi>viz.</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted almoſt to twenty four hours, and the Remiſſions anticipated alſo by their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, or comings of the Fits, the ſpace is oftentimes leſs by a night and a day. This Diſeaſe is commonly diſtinguiſhed into exquiſite and ſpurious; The exquiſite or exact Tertian Feaver is, which begins with a vehement ſhaking, to which ſucceeds a ſharp and biting heat, which goes off in ſweat, and its Fit is finiſhed in twelve hours, and that the perfect intermiſſion follows; In the ſpurious or baſtard Tertian, the cold and heat are more remiſs, but the Fit is often extended beyond twelve hours, yea often to eighteen or twenty. Theſe differ as to the various diſpoſition of the Blood, which is in the former more torrid and ſharp; therefore perverts the alible Juice from Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, towards an aduſtion, wherefore a more vehement Efferveſcency is ſtirred up; but as the matter more equally burns forth, it is ſooner finiſhed. In the latter, beſides the aduſtion, the Blood abounds with too much ſerous humidity, wherefore, the nouriſhing Juice degenerates into a Crude matter, and therefore leſs apt to be overcome, and to burn ſorth; wherefore, its Fit is gentler, and more unequal, but is not finiſhed but in a longer ſpace.</p>
                     <p>The Eſſence therefore of a Tertian Feaver conſiſts in this; That the Blood (like Beer brew'd with too high dry'd Mault) being too ſharp, and torrid, does not right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdue, and ripen the alible Juice, which is taken in from crude things eaten, but very much perverts it into a nitrous-ſulphurous matter; with which, when the maſs of Blood is filled to a ſwelling up, like new Beer ſtop'd up in Bottles, it conceives an heat: From the flux of this nitrous matter, which blunts the heat, and vital ſpirits, and pulls the nervous parts, firſt the cold, with ſhaking is excited; then the vital ſpirit geting ſtrength again, this matter growing hot in the Blood, begins to be ſubdued, and inkindled in the heart; from whoſe deflagration, an intenſe heat is diffuſed thorough the whole body; then its reliques being ſeparated, and involved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> are ſent away by ſweat.</p>
                     <p>This torrid Conſtitution of the Blood, conſiſts in this, That 'tis impregnated more than it ought, with particles of Sulphur and Salt; wherefore, the Procatartick cauſes, which diſpoſe to this Diſeaſe, are an hot and bilous temperament, a youthful age, hot dyet, as an immoderate uſe of Wine and ſpiced Meats, but eſpecially in the Spring and autumnal ſeaſons of the year, when the Blood (as all vegetables) is apt to flower, and to ferment of its own accord. By reaſon of theſe occaſions, the liquor of the Blood, is want to be thorowly roaſted, and to be changed into a cholerick temper: and when it departs from its natural Diſpoſition ſo much, that it perverts the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Juice, into a matter plainly Fermentative, the beginning of this Feaver is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; which ſometimes happens from this intemperance being leaſurely increaſed and brought to the height; but more frequently, an evident cauſe raiſes up this diſpoſition
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:107016:46"/>into act, and we aſcribe the origine of this Diſeaſe to ſome notable Accident. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, lying on the Ground, or taking cold after ſweating, or tranſpiration being any ways hindred; alſo a Surfit, or a perturbation of the Stomach, from any thing inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately eaten; and laſtly, What things ſoever ſtir up an immoderate heat in the Blood, bring the lurking diſpoſition of this Diſeaſe into act: for that, from every ſuch occaſion, the nutritious Juice, being heaped in the Blood, and ſomewhat depraved, conceives a Flux, and departing from the reſt of the Blood, ferments with a nitrous ſharpneſs, then being inkindled and ſhaken by the Spirit, and vital heat, it induces the Fit, with a very ſtrong burning.</p>
                     <p>A Tertian Feaver, is wont to be more frequent in the Spring, at which time, the Blood is livelier and richer, and therefore more fitted for this kind of Feaveriſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. If this Feaver being taken, be ended within a moderate time, tis commonly ſaid to be a Medicine, rather than a Diſeaſe; which is partly true, becauſe, by this means, the impurities of the Blood burn out, the obſtructions of the Viſcera are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, and in truth the whole body is ventilated, ſo that 'tis wholly freed from every Excrementitious matter, and the ſeminary of growing Diſeaſes. But if this Diſeaſe be long protracted, it becomes the cauſe of many Sickneſſes, and of a long want of Health. For from hence the maſs of the Blood is very much deprived of the vital Spirit, and (like Wine too much fermented) in a manner grows lifeleſs: wherefore the Jaundice, Scurvy, or Cachexia, follow this Feaver, being long er'e it be cured For by its frequent Fits, the vital Spirit very much evaporates, and becauſe it is but little reſtored by things eaten, the Blood therefore becomes weaker, and almoſt without life: In the mean time, the particles of Salt, and Sulphur, are carried forth more, and exalted; from whence, the Blood is made ſhap, and ſalt, and ſo more unfit for Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and Tranſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Moreover, This Diſeaſe being long protracted, oftentimes changes its Figure, and from a Tertian Feaver, becomes either a Quotidian, or ſometimes a Quartan: then ſometimes from either, it returns into a Tertian. The reaſon of this is, the diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood being variouſly changed: which at firſt being ſharp, and bilous, had perverted the nutritious Juice, by that means, that it ariſe to a fulneſs of ſwelling up on the third day; afterwards, by the frequent Deflagration, becoming leſs ſharp, or in truth more wateriſh, it grows far weaker as to its Conſtitution, ſo that it doth very little, or not at all aſſimulate the nouriſhable humor, and ripen it, and by that means, the increaſe of the Fermentative matter is made ſooner, and the Fits return daily: or elſe, the Blood from a ſharp and bilous intemperance, (the conſtitution of the Heaven, or the year, bringing on this alteration) is changed into an auſtere, or ſaltiſh, and therefore more ſlowly perverts the nouriſhing Juice, and the increaſe of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh matter, gathering together more flowly, it doth not conceive the Fits till on the fourth day: but if either, by the means of Phyſick or Dyet, the temper of the Blood is reduced from either Dyſcraſie, towards a bilous, the periods alſo are altered, and they reſume the figure of a Tertian.</p>
                     <p>Certain ſymptoms are wont to come upon a Tertian Feaver, which are commonly eſteemed for the Criſes of this Diſeaſe; and in truth ſometimes, theſe appearing, the Diſtemper either clearly ceaſes, or begins to abate of its wonted fierceneſs. But theſe kind of ſigns, are chiefly theſe three <hi>viz.</hi> The Eryſipelas, or an Eruption of pimples in the Lips, the yellow Jaundice, and an Inflamation, or ſwelling ſuddenly excited, in this or that part of the body: very often there happens after three or four Fits to the Sick, little ulcers, with a cruſty ſcab, to break forth about the Lips, and altho there be no coming away of any matter, in all the body beſide, yet from hence they preſage, that the Feaver is about to depart, which ſometimes the event proves true. But indeed ſometimes, I have obſerved, that the hoped for effect has not ſucceeded, but that the Feaver pertinaciouſly, and for a long while hath afflicted them, when their Lips have been broken out. But as to what reſpects this Symptom, it ſeems to ariſe, for that the Blood having got a more free Diaphoreſis, it not only thruſts forth adoors, the more thin, and ſmokie recrements, but alſo the more thick; and when the ſame, in other parts more eaſily exhale thorow the more open Pores, they ſtick in their paſſage about the Lips, by reaſon of the skin being more ſtrictly bound together; and becauſe the vaporous matter, abounds in particles of aduſt Salt, and Sulphur, being fixed in the skin, it there hinders Circulation, and therefore induces Puſtles, and little Ulcers; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the more hot breath, which is breathed forth from the mouth, and noſtrils, may contribute ſomething to this Diſtemper, foraſmuch as it ſcorches, and burns the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:107016:46"/>Blood, and Juices flowing thither: wherefore, it may be ſaid, That this eruption of Puſtles, denotes only a more full Diaphoreſis in the whole, by which, the more thick, as well as the thin recrements of the aduſt Blood, evaporate forth of doors. For I have known in ſome, from a Tertian Feaver, little welks like the ſmall Pox to break out in their whole body, that if by this more plentiful Ventilation, as it were a purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Blood be ſo freed, that it recovers its priſtine diſpoſition, the Feaver is cured: But if (as ſometimes it happens) ſome recrements, tho more thick, break forth, yet others ſtay within, and ſtill cheriſh the Feaveriſh diſpoſition, thoſe little Ulcers, argue only a greater taint of the Blood, and pertinacy of the Diſeaſe, therefore it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when that ſcabs break out in the lips, if the Feaver does not preſently abate, that it will be more grievous, and tedious for the future.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes the yellow Jaundice comes upon a Tertian Feaver, and cures it; (which <hi>Hippocrates</hi> has alſo taken notice of) the reaſon of which is, becauſe, when the Blood has got a ſharp or bilous diſpoſition; that therefore it had perverted the alible Juice, and from thence had heaped together excrementitious matter, it is oftentimes freed by that Dyſcraſie, when by a ſudden Secretion, the recrements of aduſt Salt and Sulphur, are more plentiful purged forth. This the Choleduct veſſels being irritated by Phyſick, or of their own accord, and ſo pouring out plentifully the Bile, from the Blood, do often perform: becauſe Vomiting, Purging, and eſpecially a Diarrhea or L ask, very much conduce to the cure of this Diſeaſe, yea ſometimes, the Blood it ſelf, putting forth of its own accord, thruſts forth the bilous recrements, as its off-ſcourings, and in the circulating puts them forth in the skin, and ſo inducing the yellow Jaundice, cures this Feaver.</p>
                     <p>When an Inflamation, (as ſometimes tis wont) comes upon this Diſtemper, the Ague is commonly ſaid to fall down into the part diſtempered with the Tumor. But that by ſuch a breaking forth, this Diſeaſe is cured, 'tis no wonder; becauſe the Blood by this means continually lays aſide out of his boſom, the proviſion of the degenerate nutritious Juice, and transfers it to the diſtempered part; and therefore, the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and fermentative matter in the maſs of Blood, does not eaſily ariſe to a fulneſs of ſwelling up: wherefore, the Belly being perpetually looſe, hath by degrees helped ſome, for that the Blood by this means, readily caſts forth its burthen, now growing low, and not having a more full increaſe yielded to it: ſometimes alſo, a Deaf;neſs ſuddenly ariſing, the Tertian Feaver has preſently ceaſed, to wit, by reaſon of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter, from the boſom of the Blood, into the head.</p>
                     <p>If that the Tertian Feaver, within a ſhort time, neither by the free accord of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, declines by degrees, that it doth clearly ceaſe within ſeven or ten periods, nor is cured by any of the aforeſaid means, nor is removed by the help of Medicine, but that after ten or twelve Fits, the ſick are ſtill grievouſly afflicted, it will be a very hard task to cure it: becauſe the Blood, from the continual heaping of the Feaveriſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and by the frequent burnings, becomes at length ſo depraved, that it concocts no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing truly for the nouriſhment of the Body, and for the ſuſtaining its ſtrength; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it able to ſhake thorowly out of its boſom, the impurities and excrements, whereby the Diſeaſe may make a Criſis or ſeparation, but in truth, the ſame growing in ſtrength every day, the Blood, beſides its Dyſcraſie or evil diſpoſition, begins to be hurt ſomewhat in its mixture; wherefore, more frequent Fits infeſt them, nor does a perfect Remiſſion come between, but that the ſick being very weak and languiſhing, are almoſt continually Feaveriſh, with thirſt and heat: when it is come to this paſs, unleſs they are ſuccour'd by remedies from Art, or that the change of the Place, and Air, bring timely help, this Diſeaſe often ends in death.</p>
                     <p>As to its cure: the method of healing is commonly directed to this one ſcope, to wit, that the mine of the Diſeaſe may be extirpated, and that the Feaveriſh matter may be eradicated out of our Body, without any cheriſher remaining, or fear of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing; wherefore, Vomits, and Purges are diligently Inſtituted, which when pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting nothing to the cure, but that the Patients ſtrength is very much broken, the ſick are leſt by the Phyſicians, and the buſineſs is wholly committed to Nature. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions (as it ſeems to me) ought to be of this ſort: Firſt, a reſtitution of the Blood, to its natural Temper. Secondly, a prevention of the depravation of the nouriſhing Juice, as much as may be. Thirdly, an Inhibition of the Feaveriſh Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, that the Fit may not be excited. And theſe Indications take place, not only in a Tertian Feaver, but in any other intermitting Feaver beſides: which yet are to be
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:107016:47"/>performed, not by the ſame ways and remedies, but by ſeveral, according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the Diſeaſe, of the condition of the ſick, and of the ſymptoms chiefly urging. However in the curing of this Diſeaſe, there is more to be attributed to Nature, and to a good order of Dyet, or way of Living, than to Phyſick.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Concerning the firſt Intention, to wit, that the Blood may be reduced to its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper, Vomits, letting of Blood, and Purging are of great uſe: eſpecially, if they be celebrated in the beginning of the Diſeaſe. <hi>Vomitories</hi> help, both for that they Purge the Ventricle, that the firſt Concoction may be better performed, and by that means the nouriſhing Chyme may be more purely ſupplyed, for matter of the Blood; but chiefly, for that by plentifully preſſing forth the Bile, form the Choleduct paſſage, they empty the Galiſh bag, as by that means, the Bile is poured forth more full from the maſs of Blood; and ſo the Blood is purified, from the recrements of aduſt Salt and Sulphur. The opening of a Vein, cools and ventilates the Blood, as by that means, tis leſs torrified, or ſcorched, and is circulated more freely in the Veſſels, without danger of burning. Alſo Purging, plentifully draws forth, and by provoking expreſſes, or ſqueeſes out, the Bile, from the galiſh Veſſels, and conſequently from the maſs of Blood. For this end, (to wit, the reduction of the Blood) Digeſtives bring help, the more temperate Vinegars, or Acetous things, foraſmuch as they fuſe, and alter the Blood, and do attemper its fervor. Somtimes alſo, the change of the Soil, and Air, notably amends the evil conſtitution of the Blood, before all other Remedies whatſoever.</p>
                     <p>The ſecond Intention, is excellently performed, by Dyet, and an exact manner of living; which in this Diſeaſe ought to be ſlender and ſparing: wherefore it is commonly ſaid, Starving is the beſt Remedy for this Diſeaſe: and it appears by common experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that by a more ſpare eating, the coming of the Ague fit, is very often prolonged, beyond its wonted Cuſtom. There are eſpecially two things to be obſerved, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eating and Drinking: The firſt, that the food be ſlender, that nothing Sulphureous or Spirituous be given, for ſo the Conflagration of the Blood will be leſſened; then ſecondly, that the Fit approaching, or urging, nothing of Aliment be taken, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in faſting the Fit is lighter, and ſooner finiſhed.</p>
                     <p>As to the third thing propoſed; the Inhibition of the Feaveriſh Fit, is inſtituted by Remedies, which ſtay the Fermentation of the Blood. But tho this Remedy ſeems Empirical, and unmethodical, and very failable to Phyſicians, yet I have found theſe Feavers to be very often cured by this means, when Medicines have profited nothing: What they are, and by what means, without the ſuſpicion of Witchcraft, they afford help, for the curing this Diſeaſe, is before noted. We ſhall here only advertiſe you, that the uſe of theſe is moſt profitable after Phyſick, and opening a Vein, if there be need of it; and unleſs theſe be reghtly performed before-hand, thoſe other rarely ſtop the Fit. But Vomiting, Purging, and breathing a Vein, unleſs they be preſently cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated after the beginning, yield little help, yea, more often are wont to hinder: For whilſt the Blood is ſtrong in vital ſpirit, its evil diſpoſition, may with eaſie labour be corrected, or amended: wherefore, if the Bile, about the beginning, be copiouſly drawn forth, or the Blood eventilated, it is reduced to its natural Complexion; but afterwards, in the progreſs of this Diſeaſe (the Spirit being now very much exhauſted, and the Salt and Sulphur too much exalted) if theſe kind of Evacuations be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, they do more debilitate the diſpoſition of the Blood: and therefore it is clear by obſervation, that the Tertian Feaver, is rarely or never cured, by theſe Remedies late adminiſtred, and often paſſes into a Quotidian. I my ſelf have known ſome, in the Spring time, being ſtrong in very good health, from a more ſtrong Emetick taken for prevention ſake, cauſing a violence by the Evacuation, to have preſently fallen into a Tertian Feaver; and others, for ſome time cured of this Feaver, when they had taken a ſtrong Purge, for the carrying away of the remains of the Feaveriſh matter, upon it to have fallen into a Relapſe. It may be readily ſaid, that the mine of the Diſeaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before at quiet, was ſtirred up, and brought into Act, after this manner by the Medicine: But if you conſider this thing rightly, it may rather be ſaid, that from the ſtrong Medicine, the diſpoſition of the Blood was very much hurt, and when at firſt it was prone to a bilous Dyſcraſie, that it hardly did aſſimilate the alible Juice, from this evident cauſe, it forthwith degenerated, that it wholy perverted the Nutriment, into a Fermentative matter, and ſo conceived the Feaveriſh diſpoſition. It is a common opinion, that a Tertian Feaver can ſcarce be cured, without a Vomit, wherefore ſome Medicaſters, are wont under the pretext of the neceſſity, to give to all whatſoever,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:107016:47"/>labouring with this Diſeaſe (tho languiſhing and weak) and Emetick Medicine not without great danger of life: and thoſe whom they judge wholy unfit for ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, they leave as not eaſily cureable to Nature. But (as I have often found the contrary by experience) this ſort of practice is evilly inſtituted; yea, I rather judge, for the cureing of a Tertian Feaver that Vomits are rarely or never to be required, unleſs in a ſtrong Body, and very eaſily prone to Vomiting, and when the Ventricle happens to be burthened, with excrementitious matter, but inſtead of it, that a gentle Purge, by which the load of the humors may be pleaſantly brought away may be of better uſe: becauſe, a Purge in this caſe, doth the ſame thing as a Vomit, to wit, it evacuates the choleduct Veſſels, that the Bile, being plentifully exhauſted from the Blood, the Feaveriſh Dyſcraſie is mended. But when the galiſh humor, being empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth into the Ventricle, is caſt out upwards, from thence there is great hurt brought to the ſtomach, and a mighty perturbation excited in the whole Body: But if that humour be inticed downwards by a gentle Purge, it is ſent forth of doors, without any trouble. Then, if to a gentle Purge, once or twice repeated, be added a very ſlender dyet, without fleſh it often anſwers the preſervatory Indication, that there needs no other Remedies, for the taking away the cauſe of this Diſeaſe; but that theſe being rightly performed, ſhall render beneficial thoſe things, which being either inwardly taken, or outwardly applyed, ſtop the Feaveriſh acceſſion. By this ſort of plain and eaſie inſtitution of Medicine, <hi>viz.</hi> A Purge of the infuſion of Senna, and Rhubarb, a ſlender dyet, and a Febrifuge or Ague-reſiſting Topick, laid either to the wriſts, or the breaſt, I have known very often, and in very ſhort time, Tertian Feavers cured, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of any other deſtroying Phyſick: yea, a thin dyet only, with Amulets timely adminiſtred, hath very happily cured Big-bellied women, and alſo very weak old men, whoſe ſtrength could not bear Purging. I have ſo often made tryal of this method, with good ſucceſs, that I doubt not, but that a Tertian Feaver, may as eaſily be cured, as any other Diſeaſe, if it be at the begining handled after this manner, <hi>viz.</hi> before the temper of the Blood be more hurt, by an evil manner of Dyet, or by Medicine untowardly adminiſtred. For the truth of this thing, I will relate this following Hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>A certain noble young man, indued with a bilous Temper, had caught an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Tertian Feaver; upon the approach of the Fit, he Vomited forth much yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and greeniſh Choler, then he was troubled moſt grievouſly, for many hours, with a great pain of the Heart, and moſt ſtrong Heat and Thirſt. On the day of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion there was taken from this perſon, with whom I was by chance, by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription, eight ounces of Blood, and in the afternoon was given an Emollient Glyſter, he alſo uſed a moſt ſlender Dyet, (<hi>viz.</hi> only made of Barly) He took every night going to ſleep, this Opiate, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſerve of Roſes vitriolated half a dram, of Diaſcordium a ſcruple, alſo every morning of the Salt of Wormwood a ſcruple, in a ſpoonful of the Juice of Orange: but when theſe did not ſucceed (for the Fit returned ſomwhat more remiſs, but with cruel Vomiting, as at firſt) beſides, for that this ſick perſon, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly abhor'd a Vomitory Medicine, (becauſe not long before this, from a very gentle Emetick, he had Vomited almoſt thirty times, until being diſtempered with the Cramp, and Convulſions, he was brought into great weakneſs, whit hazard of his life) therefore, the day following the aforeſaid Fit, I gave him a Potion of an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Senna, Rhubarb, and yellow Sanders, with Salt of Wormwood, in Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, by which he was Purged ten times, with eaſe: In the morning after, and three hours before he expected the Fit, I put to his wriſts an Ague-reſiſting Medicine, and took from him ſix ounces of Blood, by which means, he miſt his Feaveriſh Fit, and then being again Purged after the ſame manner, became perfectly well.</p>
                     <p>If that the Tertian Feaver, by reaſon of the evil Conſtitution of the ſick, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of errors in Dyet, or committed by Phyſick, hath more deeply rooted it ſelf, that after a long ſickneſs, the Fits ſtill grow worſe, and the ſick extreamly languiſh, with want of Strength, Thirſt, and almoſt continual Heat, want of Appetite, wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, weak Pulſe, high colour'd Urine, and very full of Contents, the Curatory method ought to be a little otherways inſtituted; In this caſe, firſt it is to be endeavour'd, that the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, may be taken away; wherefore, the ſick are to be fed, with ſlender Aliments only, as Barly broth, or Grewel, with opening Roots boiled in it, (fleſh-broth being wholly laid aſide) the Belly is to be kept looſe, (if need be) with the uſe of Emollient Clyſters; beſides (Purges being omitted) only digeſtive Medicines, which fuſe the Blood, and bring away gently the ſerous Impurities by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:107016:48"/>Urine, alſo comforting Remedies, which corroborate the Viſcera, and cheriſh the Spirits, are chiefly to be inſiſted on. To this end, Apozems are fitly to be prepared, of Herbs, and Roots gently Diuretic, alſo Opiats help very much, of temperate Conſerves, with <hi>Sal</hi> Nitre, or the fixed Salt of Herbs, with ſhelly powders, and the Spirit of Vitriol mixed together. When the diſpoſition of the Blood is ſomwhat mended, that the Urine is clearer, and leſs coloured, alſo ſleep quieter, with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of thirſt, and heat following; then may be profitably adminiſtred, Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to ſtop the Feaveriſh fit: wherefore Ague-reſiſting Amulets may be applyed to the Wriſts or to the Soles of the Feet; alſo the powder of Peruvian Bark, or of ſomthing inſtead of it; or alſo of the Barks of the Aſh-Tree, Tamarisk, or Gentian, with Salts mixed with them, and drunk in White-Wine: after the comings of the fits are taken away, and the ſick being to get ſtrength, and deſire Food, and in ſome meaſure to digeſt it, gentle Purges may be of uſe: but let the ſick ſtill abſtain, from a more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Diet, or participating of Fleſh, and they will ſhortly after recover perfect Health without any violent Purge or Phlebotomy.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Of the Quotidian Intermitting Feaver.</head>
                     <p>BEcauſe of its affinity to the Tertian Feaver, and likeneſs of fits, the Quotidian (or dayly) Feaver comes next, <hi>viz.</hi> whoſe Acceſſion is wont to return every day. It is the opinion of ſome, that this ſort of Feaver, is only a double Tertian, and doth ariſe from a diſperſed matter, having gotten a twofold Neſt; to which I cannot aſſent, and I ſuppoſe its begining is to be attributed, to a peculiar Dyſcraſie of the Blood. In this the ſymptoms of cold and heat, are more remiſs, but its is longer continued, and oftentimes it is wont to laſt eighteen or twenty hours: This Feaver for the moſt part follows a Tertian, for when the Vital Spirit is very much flown away, by the frequent deflagration of the Blood, and (the Feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſpoſition ſtill remaining) the Blood is made weaker, it doth not concoct the nouriſhing Juice, or ripen it, but perverts almoſt the whole into a Fermentative mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; wherefore it comes ſooner to its increaſe, and is gathered together to a plenitude of ſwelling up, within double the time, than at firſt. But becauſe the congeſted mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, participates equally of crudity, and aduſtion, therefore the heat of the burning is leſſer, and more unequal, and (like green wood laid on the fire) ſlowly burns; for which reaſon the fit endures longer.</p>
                     <p>Somtimes it happens, that a Quotidian Feaver, doth ariſe without a Tertian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, <hi>viz.</hi> when a Feaveriſh diſpoſition, falls upon a Cacochymic Body, or full of evil humors, and ſtuffed with depraved Juices; for then the Blood, being poor in Spirits, perrverts in a greater meaſure the nutritious Juice, and in a ſhorter time, gatheres to a fulneſs of ſwelling up: But that which begins an every days Ague, oftentimes changes its figure, and becomes a Tertian; juſt as a Tertian, often goes into a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian, becauſe between theſe Feavers, and their cauſes, there is a great vicinity; and the conſtitution of the Blood being a little chaged, it makes a tranſition from one to another. A Quotidian Intermitting Feaver, is not ſo eaſily cured as a Tertian: For whether it comes at firſt ſimple, or follows upon another Intermitting Feaver, it is ſtill excited from a ſtronger cauſe, and argues a greater dyſcraſie of the Blood, which will not preſently give way to Remedies. But alſo, if this Feaver be of long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, or comes upon another Chronical Diſeaſe, it has moſt often adjoyned to it, beſides the taint of the Blood, the infirmities of the inwards: to wit, the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoiled, eaſily affixeth its impurities, by degrees heaped up, on the Viſcera, whilſt it paſſes through their Meanders: from hence it is, that in a Quotidian Feaver, the weight of the Ventricle, an extenſion of the Hypochondria, Obſtructions, or Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, now of the Liver, now of the Spleen, or Meſentery, are joyned together; but theſe kind of diſtempers, are not the cauſe of the Feaver, (as is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) but only its product. Wherefore, in this Feaver, beſides the ſimple method
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:107016:48"/>of Cure, which is ſhown in the Tertian, many other intentions or coindications, come under conſideration: to wit, that the Ventricle be cleanſed from its load of humors, the ſtuffings of the Inwards freed, Infirmities corroborated; and that toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe, the Dyſcraſie of the Blood may be mended, and the Acceſſions of the Feaver may be reſtrained, muſt by all means be endeavoured; from whence, by reaſon of theſe kind of various intentions, we come to the Cure by a longer way: In this caſe, Vomits (if ſtrength will bear them) are of benefit before all other Medicines: alſo Purges, whereby the aſſiduous ſupply of Excrementitious matter, may be drawn forth, are often to be repeated: Beſides theſe, digeſtive Remedies, openers of Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſuch as reſtore the Ferment of the Viſcera, and Blood, and correct their evil diſpoſitions, are frequently to be adminiſtred. Wherefore, the fixed Salts of Herbs, and their Extracts, Acid Spirits of Minerals, and ſomtimes preparations of Steel, do very much help: concerning theſe main things, the task will be hard, when by reaſon of the manifold evil, many things are to be done together, yet by reaſon of the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity of the Feaveriſh fit, there is leiſure for the ſick to uſe few only. In Diſtempers ſo complicated, tho the reaſon of the method requires, the impediments to be firſt removed, and then to Cure the Diſeaſe, yet I have known, this kind of Feaver, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with many other diſtempers, in a Body full of humors, often Cured, without method, and by an Empirical way; <hi>viz.</hi> after a light proviſion of the whole, Ague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſting Remedies being outwardly applyed, have at firſt ſtoopped the Feaveriſh fit, that then there was time, for the Curing the other diſtempers, and more happy occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of healing were granted. I lately viſited a Noble Lady, who being long indued with a Cachectical habit of Body, a month after her lying in, being weak and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, was taken with a quotidian Intermitting Feaver; after ſix or ſeven fits of it, her ſtrength was ſo much caſt down, that ſhe could ſcarce riſe out of, or ſit up in her Bed; nor able to take never ſo little Food, tho very ſlender, but upon it, moſt grievous moleſtations were raiſed up, in her ſtomach; beſides, the Region of her Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and left Hypochondrium, was wholly beſet, with a hard ſhining tumor, and cruelly painful: by reaſon of her ſtrength being mightily caſt down, there was no place left for Evacuation, but the uſe of Clyſters; alſo her Stomach, being very weak, loathed all other Remedies, unleſs very grateful, and only in a very ſmall quantity. In this difficult caſe, circumſcribed between narrow limits of Curing, I counſelled theſe few things, to wit, that twice in a day, ſhe ſhould take this mixture, <hi>viz.</hi> The magiſterial water of Earth-worms two Ounces, of Elixer Proprietatis twelve drops. Moreover, I ordered to be applyed to her Ventricle, a Fomentation, of the Leaves of Sea-Wormwood, Centaury, Southernwood, with the Roots of Gentian, boiled in White-Wine, in an open Veſſel: alſo, that after the Fomentation, a Cake of Toſted-Bread, and dipped in the ſame Liquor, ſhould be worn upon her Stomach; beſides, Ague-reſiſting Medicines were ordered for her wriſts; and with theſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies only, ſhe miſt her Ague fit, on the third day, and remained free from it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards; then, by the uſe of Chalybeat Remedies, ſhe became perfectly well, within a ſhort time.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of a Quartan Feaver.</head>
                     <p>IN a Quartan Feaver, the period is longer than in the reſt; to wit, which is extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the fourth day incluſively; alſo its continuance uſes to be longer, and its cure harder: becauſe this Diſeaſe is protracted for many months, yea, oftentimes for years, and ſeldom, or ſcarce at all, is cured by Medicines.</p>
                     <p>The Fit, for the moſt part, begins with cold, and ſhaking, to which a very trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heat ſucceeds, but more remiſs than in a Tertian: Sweat for the moſt part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the Fit. At the firſt coming of the Diſeaſe, the Fits are more grievous, and very infeſtous, and keep the ſick in their Beds; yea, they make them loſe their ſtrength, and vigour of Body: But afterwards, the trouble is more eaſily born, ſo that the Fits are ſuffer'd out of Bed, and ſomtimes in a Journy, or being about any buſineſs. If it continue long, it induces the Scurvy, or Hypochondriac diſtemper, and involves men in an unhealthful condition.</p>
                     <p>The cauſes which diſpoſe to this Diſeaſe, are firſt, the conſtitution of the Soil and Air, becauſe this Diſtemper is proper to the fall of the Leaf, or Autumn, that you rarely find this Feaver to begin, but about that time: alſo in ſome places, eſpecially about the Sea-coaſts, this uſes to be general, or common to the Region, and to come upon thoſe living there, or Strangers coming thither from elſewhere. A declining age, which is paſt its <hi>acme</hi> or height, alſo a melancholick Temper, and which, by reaſon of an ill manner of living, is obnoxious to the Hypochondriac Diſtemper, cauſe this: beſides, long Feavers of another kind, and Chronical Diſeaſes, often paſs into a Quartan Feaver.</p>
                     <p>According to theſe poſitions, and rightly weighed, it may be ſaid, that a Quartan Feaver, even as the other intermitting Feavers, depends upon a vitious diſpoſition of the Blood; to wit, becauſe the nutritious Juice, being by degrees delated into the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, is perverted into a Fermentative matter; and the efferveſcency of this, heaped up even to a fulneſs of ſwelling over, conſtitutes the Fit of the Quartan Feaver. But as in this Feaver, there are ſome things, which are peculiar from the reſt, we will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, what kind of Dyſcraſie of the Blood it is in this Diſeaſe, diſtinct from the others, and by what means it excites, the very remarkable Symptoms.</p>
                     <p>The opinion, which is commonly had concerning this thing, is very far from truth: almoſt by the conſent of all, the Eſſence and beginning of a Quartan Feaver, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to a melancholick humout, heaped up ſomwhere in the firſt paſſages, and there periodically Putrifying. Inſtead of this, we affirm, that in this Diſeaſe, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Blood, doth paſs from a ſweet, ſpirituous, and balſamick, into an acid, and ſomwhat auſtere Nature, like Wine growing ſowre: to wit, there is too great a want of Spirits, and the Terreſtrial, or Tartareous part of the Blood, (which conſiſts chiefly of Salt, and Earth) is too much exalted, and being carried forth into a Flux, induces the ſourneſs of the maſs of Blood. Even as Beer, being diſturbed by Thunder, and infected with a troubled lee or dregs, grows ſour. The Blood, after this manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated, from its native diſpoſition, doth not rightly dreſs the alible Juice, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milate it to it ſelf, but perverts it into an extraneous matter; with which, when it is ſatisfied to a fulneſs, in the veſſels, and the nervous parts are watered by the Juice, from thence ariſing, a Flux of this matter, and as it were a ſpontaneous effervency follows, by which indeed, the Feaveriſh Fit is induced, with ſhivering and heat, as is wont to be in a Tertian.</p>
                     <p>In a Quartan Feaver, the periods have longer intervals, becauſe, when the Dyſcraſie of the Blood is become ſouriſh, and therefore leſs violent and hot, it perverts the alible Juice without ſtrife, or tumult: wherefore, it aſſimilates ſome of it, and the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reſt, does not ſo far recede from its natural ſtate, as in a Tertian, and from hence, its congeſtion to a plenitude, is made longer, and almoſt in another half of that time, in which a Tertian riſes up to a Turgeſcency: And therefore, thoſe taken with this Feaver, are indifferently well, and are ſtrong; which is a ſign, that the nutritious
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:107016:49"/>Juice is leſs depraved; alſo, the Fits are made without cruel burning, becauſe the nutritious humor, is perverted into a fermentative matter, without great aduſtion.</p>
                     <p>But why this Diſeaſe is ſo hard to be cured, and ſo pertinaciouſly infeſts the ſick, the cauſe is, the melancholic conſtitution of the Blood, which is not eaſily to be taken away, and yields almoſt to no Remedies. The cholerick diſpoſition of the Blood, is mended by the frequent Deflagration, and ceaſes often of its own accord, even as too rich Wines are depreſſed, by their own growing hot, and are wont to be reduced into their due ſtate: but this melancholick Dyſcraſie of the Blood, in which, with a want and defect of Spirits, Salt and Earth are too much exalted, (as when Wines grow ſour) is moſt hard to be reſtored, and is almoſt of the ſame labour and difficulty, as to put again life, and a vinous Spirit, into Vinegar: For that the Blood, depraved after this manner, may be reſtored, it will be needful, that its whole maſs ſhould be volatili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and as it were made Spiritual anew: wherefore, in this caſe, evacuations profit not a jot, yea, by more depauperating the Blood, oftentimes the ſtrength is caſt down, beyond help: but they had need to exalt, and make volatile what is fixed, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote a Tranſpiration, or Spiritualiſation, in the whole maſs of Blood: From hence it is, that in this Diſeaſe, the change of the Air and Region, moſt often brings help, before all other Remedies: For the Spring following, oftentimes takes away thoſe Quartan Feavers, that had ariſen the Autumn before: which without doubt happens, becauſe the changed condition of the Air, is wont to alter for the better, the evil diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Blood: alſo for the ſame reaſon, the change of the place, moſt often cures this Diſtemper, inexpugnable to all Phyſick.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, wherefore this Diſeaſe chiefly begins in the Autumn; and rarely in the Spring, or Summer time; I ſay, the Autumnal time doth moſt fitly produce this kind of Feaveriſh diſpoſition of the Blood, for when very much of the Spirit, and Sulphur, hath flown away by the Summers heat, and that what is left begins to be bound up by the cold; the Liquor of the Blood, (as Wine growing ſour by too much heat) eaſily degenerates into a ſaltiſh, and acidulous or ſharp Nature: This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, the Sea air, by infecting the Blood and Spirits, with ſaline Vapours falling on them, eaſily procures: yea, alſo the affinity of this Diſeaſe, with the Scurvy, and Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac diſtemper, plainly ſhews, the evil diſpoſition of the Blood to be in fault, whereby it becomes ſalt, and earthy, with the want of Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Concerning Quartan Feavers, the laſt year was ſo abundantly fruitful of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that many might collect by ocular Inſpection, whatever belong to this Diſeaſe; for when the moſt hot Summer was paſt, about the end of it, an Epidemical Feaver (of which in another place you ſhall have a deſcription) followed; then the Autumn coming on, when that Diſeaſe had ceaſed, a Quartan Feaver began very much to rage; that in very many places, the fourth part of the people was taken with it: neither did it only infeſt old men, ſplenitick and melancholick men, but of every age and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, alſo Infants, Children, and young men ordinarily: which was clearly a ſign, that this Diſtemper had drawn its riſe, not from a melancholick humour, heaped up, by the default of the Spleen, but from the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, brought in, through the intemperance of the year: for the maſs of the Blood, after too great heats, even as Wines after immoderate efferveſcencies, was made fit to grow ſomwhat ſour, or to get an auſtere diſpoſition, and ſo alſo prone to this ſort of Feaver, as is already ſhewed.</p>
                     <p>If the Remedies, which for the Curing of this, have been made tryal of, both by Phyſicians and Empericks, were collected together, their deſcription would ſwell into a great Volumn; but altho there is inſtituted, a manifold proviſion of Medicine, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this evil, yet very few are cured in the Autumn. In ſome, about the begining of their ſickneſs, before the Diſeaſe has taken too deep root, a Vomit hath brought help; but in moſt, all manner of Cathartics, tho an hundred times repeated, have profited nothing. In whom the evil had deeply implanted it ſelf, the ſick received no help, from the moſt ſtudied Medicines made uſe of all the Autumn. But when at this time, I perceived the ordinary method of Medicine, was adminiſtred in vain, I propoſed to a Noble Virgin, requiring a ſudden Cure, by any means, to be performed, that if ſhe would indure a Flux at the Mouth, for ſome days, from a Mineral Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, by that means, it might be hoped, that the Diſeaſe would be profligated. When ſhe had readily aſſented to this, I gave her a gentle, and very ſafe Medicine, by which a light ſpitting only was provoked, and that finiſhed within twelve days: As ſoon as the Salivation began, ſhe miſt her fits, but at thoſe times they were wont to come ſhe felt a perturbation in her whole Body, with an oppreſſion of the Heart, and dread
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:107016:50"/>of ſwooning, but after the ſpitting was finiſhed, ſhe appear'd very well; and when again after two months ſpace, ſhe was troubled with ſome light fits of this Diſeaſe, from an Emetick pouder, twice or thrice taken, ſhe was wholly cured without relaps<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>After the winter Solſtice, this Diſeaſe began to rage leſs, and to ceaſe in ſome of its own accord, and in many others, to be eaſily expung'd by the uſe of Phyſick: becauſe at this time, the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, contracted by the Summers heat, is wont to be blotted out leiſurely, by reaſon of the cold of the Winter, and the maſs of Blood growing old, as it were to put off its old ſpoils, and to be reduced towards its natural State. But thoſe, who were of a melancholick temper, or had their viſcera, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the Spleen, evilly affected, or that uſed an ill manner of Dyet, received no change at this Tropick, but to the next period of the year, <hi>viz.</hi> to the vernal Equinox, or the Spring, kept the Diſeaſe; and then in moſt, the Blood being either reſtored of it ſelf, or its intemperance more eaſily mended by the uſe of Remedies, this Diſtemper was ſeen to be overcome: But in the mean time, many old men, and ſuch as were full of evil humours, or otherways unhealthy, ordinarily dyed, in all that ſpace of time, of this Diſeaſe; alſo ſome liv'd, who could not ſhake off its yoak, tho the Summer Solſtice were paſt. But altho very many had labour'd with this Feaver, as it were Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, almoſt thorow the whole year, yet none (that I know) contracted it firſt in the Spring, and very few grew well of it during the Autumn, that in truth, I do not doubt, the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, to be the cauſe of this, and the cure to conſiſt in the change of it.</p>
                     <p>The Remedies, which moſt often brought help, (as appeared at leaſt to our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation) were of this ſort, which did reſtrain the Feaveriſh Fit: for the evils of the diſpoſition of this ſort, which did reſtrain the Feaveriſh Fit: for the evils of the changed, if now the habitual cuſtom of the Fits were broken off, Nature recollected her ſelf, and eaſily recover'd the priſtine ſtate of health, by her own endeavour. And this kind of intention, (to wit, the inhibition of the Fits) tho ſomtimes performed by Vomits, given a little before the coming of the Fit, (for theſe did not rarely ſtop the Feaveriſh motion of the Blood, by raiſing up another motion contrary to this) yet this Indication is far more certainly, and indeed happily effected, by the uſe of thoſe kind of Medicines, which do not altogether, evacuate from the Viſcera, but induce, either a certain fixation to the Blood, or a precipitation of the Feaveriſh matter, for a time. Wherefore, thoſe whom I undertook to cure, in the Spring, and afterwards; I handled (and in moſt with good ſucceſs) with this method; a proviſion being made of the whole, ſomtimes with an Emetic Medicine, ſomtimes with a Solutive; I was wont three hours before the Fit, to lay a peculiar Ague-Medicine to the wriſts, and together, to give them to drink in Sack, an Ague-reſiſting pouder, and to order the ſick to be kept in Bed in a gentle ſweat: It ſeldom hapned, but at the firſt, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, the Feaveriſh Fit, was by this means reſtrained, and then, by the ſame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, ſomtimes reiterated, the Diſeaſe at laſt wholly ceaſed. To this kind of practice, (beſides our experience) the uſe of the pouder, of a certain Bark, brought of late from the Indies, ſeems to give ſome Faith, and approbation; which is ſaid, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to cure this Diſeaſe; but the vertue, or operation of this, without any evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conſiſts in this only, that it hinders the coming of the Feaveriſh Fits.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this Peruvian Bark, becauſe of late it hath begun to be in uſe, there are ſome things to be ſaid, which offer themſelves to common obſervation. The common manner of exhibiting this is, that two drams of it beaten to pouder, be infuſed in Sack, or Whitewine, in an open Glaſs, for two hours, and then upon the coming of the Fit, the Patient being put to Bed, that the liquor and pouder be drunk up. This potion often takes away the approaching Fit, yet oftentimes tho taken after the wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, it prevents the next, however, either in the firſt, ſecond, or third period, the Fit is inhibited, and the Diſeaſe ſeems to be cured, it is often wont to return, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty or thirty days; then this pouder being again exhibited, the Diſeaſe is for a time deferred about the ſame ſpace, and by this means, I have known many ſick of a Quartan, to have ſuffered ſome few Fits only, a whole Autumn, and Winter, and ſo to have detained the enemy in his precincts, till the Spring coming on, the diſpoſition of the Blood is altered, for the better, by the help of the time of year, and of other Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and ſo this diſtemper vaniſhes by degrees. Thoſe who by this means, have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured theſe frequent truces of the Quartan, have liv'd chearful, lively, and ready for any buſineſs, when otherwiſe, being weak, and pale, they were brought into languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:107016:50"/>and a vitious habit of Body: ſcarce one of an hundred, hath tryed this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine in vain, yea, if but half, or a leſſer quantity, <hi>viz.</hi> the weight of but one dram, taken, it very often takes away the Fits, and ſuſpends the ſame, a ſhorter ſpace only; neither is it any matter, whether it be taken in ſtrong, or ſmall Wine, unleſs with the reſpect, to the diſpoſition of the ſick: becauſe in a more hot temper, it may be profitably taken in diſtilled Water, or Whey; alſo, a clear infuſion of it, the more thick ſubſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt away, produces the like effect, but of ſhorter durance: I have taken care to reduce this powder into Pills, with the mucilage of Tragacanth, with a little coſt to the ſick, to be given to ſome; after what manner ſoever it is taken, unleſs, to thoſe loathing and abhorring every Medicine, it cauſes no manifeſt evacuation, and takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Fit, almoſt from all; neither is it only in a Quartan Feaver, but in the other kinds of intermitting Feavers, to wit, in every one where there is any remiſſion coming between, given with good ſucceſs. It is commonly ordered, that a gentle Purge ſhould be taken before this, but in ſome who are very weak, and keep their Beds, this powder being taken carefully, without any previous Medicine, hath procured laudable effects. In the mean time, I will ingeniouſly confeſs, that I have not ſeen an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feaver quite cured, by this Bark, once taken: nay, rather the Fits not only of a Quartan, but of a Tertian, and Quotidian Feaver, wholly overcome eaſily by other Remedies, ſeeming to be driven away by this powder, have conſtantly return'd after a ſhort time. For this Reaſon, they who ſuppreſs intermitting Feavers, otherways eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curable, no neceſſity urging them, by this Medicine, for a little while, only ſeem to inſtitute a deceitful Medicine, and do no more than thoſe, who skin over a rotten ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which will ſhortly break out again; in truth, in ſome caſes, the uſe of this will be requiſite, <hi>viz.</hi> when by thy too great aſſiduity of the Fits, the ſpirits of the ſick are caſt down, truces are by this means procured, by which Nature may recollect her ſelf, and afterwards may be more able to fight againſt this potent Enemy: alſo, that a Quartan Feaver, during the Autumn and Winter, may paſs over with little trouble, this Bark is profitably adminiſtred: But thoſe, who expect a longer reſting time, from the aſſaults of this Feaver, are bid to take this powder in greater quantity, and more often, to wit, that they ſhould take two drams, three ſeveral times one after another, whether the Fits return or no; by this means, they remain longer free, yet they retain within, the Enemy ſtill, tho aſleep.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, concerning the Nature of this Bark, and the virtue in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the fits of Intermitting Feavers, it is not to be diſſembled, that 'tis very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to explicate the cauſes of theſe kind of effects, and the manner of working; becauſe, there is not found as yet in any Subject, beſides, the like efficacy; but from a ſingular experiment, a general Reaſon is not to be rightly fitted: however, from the appearances diligently Collated, we will deduce ſome Theſes in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which may make at leaſt ſome ſteps towards, if not obtain the verity of this thing.</p>
                     <p>It is to be noted therefore, in the firſt place, that this Medicine, being inwardly taken, eſpecially exerciſeth its force and energy on the maſs of Blood; becauſe, it does not at all irritate the Viſcera, neither cauſes in them any excretion, or trouble; beſides, whilſt it communicates its virtue to the Blood, it doth not at all put forth An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifeaveriſh property; wherefore, not always the next following fit, but the ſecond, or the third, is prevented, by the ſame being taken: and for this reaſon, that it may ſooner affect the Blood, it is a uſual thing, to drink the Liquor, very much impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with the ſame powder, for ſo its Particles are more eaſily conveyed into the maſs of Blood. Secondly, the virtue of this Bark, being impreſſed on the Blood, ſtays in it for ſome time, and that either ſhorter or longer, according as either a greater or leſſer portion of the Medicine was taken inwardly; for the Particles of this, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed with the Blood, are a long while circulated with it, and by how much the longer they ſtay, by ſo much the more they affect its maſs, and produce a longer effect: for though Aliments, and ſome other things taken in, for that they are preſently over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the native heat, put off whatever they have of virtue, within ſome few hours, this being then aſſimilated or ſent forth adoors, they ceaſe to operate: yet ſome Medicines being taken inwardly, becauſe they are not eaſily tamed, nor caſt forth of doors preſently, by an irritation ſtirred up, they remain for many days very active, and hold a long time the Juices, and the Blood, in this or that manner of Fermentation, this may be obſerved of ſome Medicines, alſo of Poyſons, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoyſons, the once or twice taking of which, for ſome days, is wont to affect our
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:107016:51"/>Bodies for a longer time; for 'tis an uſual thing with Cathartic Medicines, when they work little by Vomit, or Stool, to break forth after many weeks outwardly, in Puſtles and Wealks: yea, if Death be avoided, from the drinking of Poyſon, every body knows, that the virulency will lie hid, a long time in the Blood and Juices. In like manner alſo, this powder, and perhaps very many other things inwardly taken, altho they ſeem aſleep, yet continue to act, on the Spirits and Humors.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, altho this Medicine acts immediately on the Blood and Humors, yet it takes not wholly away, the Feaveriſh Dyſcraſie, implanted in them: for, as ſoon as its force is conſumed, and all its Particles are flown away, from the mixture of the Blood, the Diſtemper being only ſuppreſſed for a time, at length riſes up, and repeats its fits after its wonted manner, but foraſmuch as Nature, by the ſpace of this ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becomes ſtronger, therefore, after the Relaps, the fits (not as before) but on the third or fourth day, according to the firſt figure of the Diſeaſe, are wont to return.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, It is remarked, that this Remedy, does not ſtop the Feaveriſh acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the ordinary Ague-reſiſters or Febrifuges, by fixing, or alſo by fuſing the Blood; for then the next fit always, and not the ſecond, or third following after, is prevented.</p>
                     <p>According to which poſitions, that we may inſtead of a Corollary, ſubjoin ſome things concerning the manner it ſelf of working, whereby this Medicine ſeems to act; we ſay, it is moſt likely, that when the Particles, proceeding from the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, are throughly mixed with the Blood, they compel it into a certain new Fermentation, by which, whilſt the Particles of the Blood are continually agitated, they are wholly hindered, that they cannot heap up any Excrementitious matter, or enter into Feaveriſh turgeſcencies; for, as after the biting of a mad dog, or ſtinging of any venemous Creatures, the Blood it ſelf, and nervous Juice, are a long while impoyſoned, yet leſt they ſhould conceive preſently great irregularities, Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſons being taken, do hinder their Liquors, by retaining them in another Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; the uſe of which, if ſo long continued, whilſt the virulent little Bodies are quite flown away, no horrid ſymptom is to be feared, from that evil being contracted; but if the ſtrength of the Remedy, being too ſparingly given, be firſt conſumed, forth with the Venom repullulates, and the old Poyſon, thought to have been exploded, is at length brought into act: by the ſame way, when the Blood, having gotten a vitious diſpoſition, perverts the Alible Juice, and whereby it might more rightly expel it, heaped together to a fulneſs, conceives Feaveriſh ſwellings up; this Peruvian Bark be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten, and adminiſtred, by the Commerce of its Particles, ſo agitates the Blood, tho diſtempered with an evil diſpoſition, with a new excited Fermentation, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it, that it in ſome meaſure concocts the nouriſhable Juice, and continually eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates its Recrements, that they are not heaped together as before, into the matter of a fit: But, when the Particles of this Remedy, are wholly flown away, from the company of the Blood, and the whole virtue conſumed, the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, before contrancted, at length riſes up, and ſo the Feaveriſh fits return, after their wonted manner. Somtimes perhaps it happens, that whilſt the Feaveriſh fits are ſuppreſſed, by the uſe of this powder, by reaſon of the ſeaſon of the year being changed, or by the help of another Remedy, or by the endeavour of Nature it ſelf, that Dyſcraſie of the Blood may be mended, by degrees, and ſo the Feaver may at length vaniſh, of its own accord. This I have known to happen, but very rarely, becauſe almoſt with the ſame certainty, by which you expect the Feaver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh fits to be ſuppreſſed, by that powder, you may afterwards look for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
                     <p>As to what appertains to the ſenſible qualities, with which this Bark is noted, it appears to abound with bitterneſs, and a certain ſtipticity, that it ſeems to the taſt, to have the likeneſs of Savor, which is in moſt Conterpoyſons, as the Root of Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Serpentary, Contrayerva, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for what are bitter in act, are ſtrong in excellent virtue, for the ſuppreſſing the force of preternatural Ferments; yea, the Root of Gentian, which is likeſt to this Bark, was in times paſt of famous uſe, for the Curing of Quartan Feavers. But now, altho this Peruvian powder, be the only Alexiterion or Counter-poyſon, as yet found out againſt a Quartan Feaver, to wit, that inhibits (tho only for a time) its fits, and of other Intermitting Feavers, yet it is not to be doubted; but that there are in the world, other Medicines extant, which are as good Ague reſiſters; and it is hoped, that led by the example of this new invention, we may be excited, to the finding out the virtues of Herbs, almoſt as yet unknown: ſo,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:107016:51"/>whilſt we ſhall inſiſt on the trial of ſeveral, and the Empirical be joyned to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Medicine, without doubt the Cures of the Quartan Ague, and of other invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible Diſeaſes, may more happily be accompliſhed; which therefore I promiſe more willingly to this Age, or at leaſt to the next, when being led by the Analogy of this Book, I have found out a Medicine, for the profligating of Feavers, of uſe not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, it not being long ſince variouſly tryed, which alſo I am wont to give to the poorer ſort, inſtead of ſomthing elſe, with good ſucceſs.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of continual Feavers.</head>
                     <p>A Continual Feaver is that, whoſe fit is continued for many days, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion: It hath its times of remiſſion, and of more fierceneſs, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of intermiſſion; the burning is now more remiſs, now more intenſe, but ſtill the ſick are in a Feaver, until by the temperament, or inſenſible growing well, the Diſeaſe is wholly Cured. Concerning this, it behoves us to inquire, what Efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of the Blood it is, which cauſes a continual Feaver; then, by what ways, and from what cauſes, it is wont to be excited: alſo, how it differs from that, which is in Intermitting Feavers. And theſe being performed, we will deſcend to the Species of Continual Feavers.</p>
                     <p>There are many ways, by which the Blood growing hot, induces a continual Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vear, the chief of which may be reduced to theſe Heads: The firſt way is, when the more ſpirituous, and ſubtil Portion of the Blood, becomes too hot, and is diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, with a certain burning, which therefore agitates the other parts of the Blood, and incites it into a certain rage, ſo that the Sulphur, or the Oily part of the Blood, is more diſſolved, and more inkindled in the Heart, alſo, for that cauſe, there is among all the Particles of the Blood, a certain ſyncriſis, contrariety, or perturbation, by which in truth, being confuſed, and put out of order, they are not able quickly to be extricated, and reduced into their former poſture, wherefore, a heat and burning more than is wont to be, is ſtirred up in the whole Body: but when the Spirits are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in fault, their heat and diſorder, are wont within a ſhort ſpace, to be allaied of their own accord, therefore, this Feaver is often terminated within a day, and is rarely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued beyond three: and therefore, is called an Ephemera, or a Feaver of a day, or Synochus of more dayr,</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The ſecond manner, or degree of growing hot, is when the Sulphureous or Oily part of the Blood, being too much heated, conceives a Fervor: for then, it both grows immoderately hot in the Veſſels, and being very much inkindled in the Heart, produces by its deflagration, a very ſtrong heat in the whole Body. Indeed the Blood, as to its temper, moſtly depends on the condition of the Sulphur; when by reaſon of crudity, the Sulphur is leſs diſſolved, the Blood is made watery and cold, and is moved ſlowly in the Veſſels: but if the Sulphureous, or Oily part of the Blood, grows hot, beyond its Natural diſpoſition, preſently it becomes fierce, and impropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate with the reſt, ſo that, almoſt the whole being acted, as it were into a flame, by the Ferment of the Heart, compels the maſs of Blood to grow immoderately hot, and to boil up. For as when Wines, indued with a rich Lee, are ſtirred up into an heat, by the too rancid Sulphur; or as Hay, laid up too wet, by reaſon of the want of Ventilation, conceives of its own accord a burning, the Particles of the Sulphur being looſned from the mixture; in like manner, when the Blood is not rightly ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated, but being reſtrained from Evacuation, by reaſon of the admixtion of ſome hot thing, or a more plentiful ſanguification; or for ſome other cauſe, the Particles of the Sulphur begin to be thickly gathered together; preſently, all its Liquor, immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately boils up, by the Sulphurs being looſned, and inflamed in the Heart, and this kind of Feaver is induced, which is called a putrid Synochus; notwithſtanding which appellation, tho of many rejected, for that the Blood ſo long as it is in motion, doth not putrifie; yet foraſmuch, as in this Feaver, the mixture of the Blood, is ſomwhat
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:107016:52"/>looſned, by the Sulphur being too much exalted, and the maſs of its Liquor being changed, from its Natural diſpoſition, tends toward putrefaction, therefore, the term of a putrid Feaver, as hath been anciently uſed, may be ſtill, with good reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The third degree of growing hot, (and which conſtitutes a diſtinct kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver) is excited, from a certain malignant, and invenomed Ferment, by which, when the maſs of the Blood is imbued, and the Spirits, and the Sulphureous part together, conceive an heat, and their burning is not ſooner appeaſed, than that either that malignant matter be conſumed, and caſt forth of doors, or elſe a certain coagulation, and as it were putrefaction, of the Blood, from its corruptive venom is induced, by which, both circulation is hindered, and the Vital Spirit extinguiſhed. This malignity is wont to ariſe, either from a certain contagion received from without, or from ſome infection begotten within us; according to theſe ways the malignant Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Small-pox, Meaſels, and alſo the Plague, draw their beginnings, and by their contagion, far and near ſet upon many.</p>
                     <p>There are therefore three degrees, or manners of growing hot, by which, the kinds of continual Feavers are determined. From the ſubtil portion of the Blood made hot, or the Ebullition of the Spirits, the Ephemera ariſes, as alſo the Synochus of one or more days; by the Sulphureous, or Oily part of the Blood, being too hot and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled, the putrid Feaver is ſtirred up, then thirdly, upon an invenomed taint, infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Blood, and congealing its Liquor, malignant Feavers depend. In every one of theſe, by the depravation, or rather corruption of the Alible Juice, freſh car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the Blood, the various fits, inequalities, and critical motions ariſe. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter upon the ſeveral kinds of a continued Feaver, it is requiſite for me, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how the growing hot of the Blood, in a continual Feaver, differs from that other, which conſtitutes Intermitting Feavers.</p>
                     <p>I ſay therefore, that the growing hot of the Blood, in an Intermitting Feaver, depends only, upon the commixtion of a certain Fermentative matter, and not rightly miſcible, with the Blood, and on its growing up, to a fulneſs of boiling over. Becauſe of this heat, with the Blood in the Veſſels, and of the deflagration in the Heart, the fit is induced; becauſe of its growing cool, the intermiſſion follows, that in the coming between of the fits, neither the Spirits, nor Sulphur, become outra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, but the bond of the mixture being kept whole, the Liquor is circulated in the Veſſels, equally, and without trouble: on the contrary, in a continual Feaver, the diſorders of the Spirits, and of Sulphur, of either, or both together, by their proper Ebullition, alſo without the mixture of any other, ſtir up the Ebullition of the Blood; wherefore, there are required, for an intermiſſion, beſides the difflation or colling of the Excrementitious matter, a deflagration of the inkindled Blood, and a reduction of it to its due Temper.</p>
                     <p>The Conſtitution of the Blood in a continual Feaver, is of the ſame ſort as of Wines, when they grow hot upon too rich a Lee; to wit, are mighty in Spirit, and grow turgid with exalted Sulphur, and therefore they conceive a Fervor, and greatly boil up, of their own accord, without the mixture of any other thing. In an Intermitting Feaver, the Blood is moved after that manner, as Wines, when they conceive an heat, becauſe of ſomthing poured to them, that is not miſcible with them: More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, in this Feaver, the diſpoſition of the Blood is of that ſort, as of Wines, when in their decay and declination, they become ropy, unſavory, or acid, to wit, in which the Spirit is depreſſed, that in the mean time, either Salt, or Sulphur, or both together, appear above the reſt, and infect the whole Liquor with their diſorder. An Intermitting Feaver, for the moſt part, is free from danger, becauſe the conſtitutive parts of the Blood, altho they ſhould ſomwhat change their diſpoſition, however, keep the bond of mixture, and whilſt they are in power, are circulated equally in the Veſſels, yea they pervert the nutritious Juice, into a matter, not altogether beſides Nature, but rather infeſting, with its fulneſs and turgeſcency. In a continual Feaver, beſides the intemperance, the mixture of the Blood, and conſtitution of the Liquor, are ſomwhat looſned, and its corruption eaſily follows; wherefore this Diſeaſe often ends in death: further, the nouriſhing Juice is depraved, into a matter wholly viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and altogether infeſtous to Nature.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Ephemera or Feaver for a Day.</head>
                     <p>I Have ſaid, the leaſt degree of heat, which induces a continual Feaver, is placed in the ſubtil, and Spirituous part of the Blood, being too much agitated and heated; for this, like the Spirit of Wine, boils up on every light occaſion, and conceives a fervor, by a too great motion of the Body, or perturbation of mind, by the ambient heat as of the Sun or vapours, by hot things taken inwardly, as the drinking of Wine, and the eating of peppered meats, and being irritated by ſuch like. For the Spirits of the Blood, eaſily take fire, and being impetuouſly moved, are not preſently appeaſed, but they move throughly other Particles of the Blood, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly confound, and ſnatch them, into a rapid and diſorderly motion; alſo from this motion of the Spirits, the Sulphur, or Oily part of the Blood, is more boiled forth, ſomwhat more diſſolved, and ſomthing more fully inkindled in the Heart, by which means, an intenſe heat is raiſed up, in the whole Body. But foraſmuch, as Sulphur is inkindled, and inflamed only by ſmall parts, and not in the whole, that fervor of the Spirits is quickly appeaſed, and ceaſes: wherefore, the Feaver which is excited by this means, for the moſt part is terminated, within twenty four hours, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is called an Ephemera, or a Feaver of a day. If that by reaſon of a greater heat of the Spirituous Blood, it is prolonged further, it rarely exceeds three days, and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an Ephemera of more days, or a Synochus not putrid: but if it ſhould happen to be lengthned beyond this time, this Feaver eaſily paſſes into a putrid, <hi>viz.</hi> from the dayly Ebullition of the Spirituous Blood, the more thick Particles of the Sulphur, at length begin to take fire, and involve the whole maſs of Blood, in its Efferveſcency: even as the Spirit of Turpentine, being ſhut up in a Cucurbit, and being put into a Sand Furnace, if it be forced with a moderate heat, boils up gently, as the Blood in a Feaver of day; but if the heat be made more ſtrong; the Liquor grows im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuouſly hot, till it breaks forth into a flame, to which the inflamation of the Blood, in a putrid Feaver, may be very aptly compared.</p>
                     <p>The Days Feaver, and Synochus ſimple, rarely begin without an evident cauſe: Beſides what hath been but now ſaid, immoderate Labour, Watchings, a ſudden paſſion of the mind, a conſtriction of the pores, a Surfeit, alſo a Bubo or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed Sore, a Wound, the coming down of the Milk in Child-bearing Women, are wont to induce them; The procatartic Cauſes, which diſpoſe to this, are an hot temper of Body, an active habit, a ſedentary life, and diſuſe of exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>The chief beginnings of this Diſeaſe, depend upon the preſence of the evident cauſe: for either, little Bodies of extraneous heat, being confuſed with the Blood, like water boiling over the fire, make it to boil up; or this Feaver is induced, by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or by reaſon of tranſpiration being ſtopped; even as Wines made hot by moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or when too cloſely ſtopped in the Ton, are put into a Fervor: but what way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever an inflamation is firſt excited, preſently the Spirits become enraged, and being moved hither and thither, compel the Blood to boil up, and to be inlarged into a greater ſpace, with a ſpumous rarefaction: wherefore, the Veſſels are diſtended, and the membranous parts hauled, hence follow pain, chiefly in the Head and Loins, a ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous wearineſs, and as it were an inflation of the whole Body. If that, with the Spirit of the Blood, a certain Sulphureous part, be alſo in ſome meaſure inkindled, a ſharp heat is diffuſed through the whole, the Pulſe is vehement and quick, the Urine red, alſo thirſt, watchings, and many other ſymptoms infeſt, the reaſons of which are added hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Solution, or Criſis of the Ephemeran Feaver, and of the not putrid Synochus, three things are chiefly requiſite: <hi>viz.</hi> a removing of the evident cauſe, ſecondly a ſeparation, and a ſcattering of the depraved, or excrementitious matter, from the maſs of Blood: Thirdly, a quieting of the parts of the Blood, and a reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, to their natural and equal motion and ſite. According as theſe ſucceed, now more ſuddenly, now more ſlowly, and difficully, this Diſeaſe is finiſhed in a ſhorter, or longer time.</p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:107016:53"/>
                     <p n="1">1. The evident cauſe, which for the moſt part is extrinſick, is eaſily removed, and the ſick are wont, preſently to avoid the preſence, or aſſiduity of that thing, and do perceive a ſenſe of any thing that is hurtful; none taking a Feaver from Wine, will ſtill indulge the drinking of it, as ſoon as any one grows more than uſually hot, in a Bath, or the heat of the Sun, 'tis a trouble to them to ſtay longer.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Excrementitious matter, which ought to be ſcattered, and ſeparated from the Blood: this is either brought from without, as when the Blood is infected by ſurfeit, drinking of Wine, ſitting in the Sun, or from a too hot Bath, with <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or little dry, and Fermentative Bodies; or this matter is begotten within, as when its Liquor is ſtuffed with recrements, or aduſt Particles, from the deflagraton of the Blood. Either of theſe matters, ought to be ſearated from the Blood, to be diſperſed, and either by ſweat, or inſenſible breathing forth, to be thruſt out of doors, before the Feaver be appeaſed; wherefore, when as the pores are bound up, and tranſpiration hindred, the Ephemeran Feaver is longer protracted, and ſomtimes paſſes, from a ſimple Synochus, into a putrid.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The evident cauſe being removed, and this degenerate matter diſperſed, there is required for the remiſſion, a quieting, and reducing into order, the parts of the Blood; for diverſe Particles of the Blood, being after this manner confuſed; and by reaſon of the Feaveriſh heat, carried up and down, they do not preſently get again the former order of ſituation and poſition; but it is needful, that they be by degrees extricated, and by little and little reſtored, to a juſt mixture.</p>
                     <p>Although this Diſeaſe, after the removing of the evident cauſe, for the moſt part ceaſes of its own accord, within a while, yet ſome Medicinal Remedies may be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, with good ſucceſs, eſpecially, when there is danger, leſt the Ephemeran Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ſhould paſs into a putrid, The chief intentions ſhould be, to ſuppreſs the fervor of the Blood, and to procure a more free tranſpiration; to the which conduce, firſt a breathing of a Vein, a ſlender diet, or rather abſtinency, cooling drinks, and a bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away the filth of the Belly, by Clyſters: Sleep, and Reſt, greatly help, above all the reſt; which, if wanting ſhould be procured in time, by Opiats, and Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynes.</p>
                     <p>Verily, altho the Hiſtories, and Obſervations of thoſe, diſtempered with an Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meran Feaver, contain in themſelves nothing very rare; yet I ſhall ſubjoin an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple or two, in this place, whereby the delineation or type of this Diſeaſe, may be illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</p>
                     <p>A certain young Gentleman, about twenty years of Age, endued with a ſtrong ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body, by the immoderate drinking of ſtrong Wine, fell into a Feaveriſh di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, with thirſt, heat, and with a great burning of his Precordia; being let Blood, he drank a great quantity of fair water, and upon it preſently a plentiful ſweat following, he grew ſhortly well: In this caſe, the more thin portion of the Blood, being heated by the Spirits of the Wine, fell into a rage, cauſed the whole maſs of Blood to be ſhaken, and its frame to be looſned, more than twas wont; and for that reaſon, that hapned to be more diſſolved, by the Ferment of the Heart, and to be as it were inkindled by the active Particles, looſned from the mixture; until the Veſſels being emptied by Phlebotomy, the raging Blood was cooled, and by the drinking of the water, its fervor was attempered; then the hot <hi>Effluvia,</hi> being involved, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the aduſt matter, with a copious <hi>Serum,</hi> and ſent away by Sweat, the Blood at length recovered its due temper. Moreover, an ingenious young man, of a ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life, and alſo very much addicted to the Study of Learning, when he had for ſomtime exerciſed himſelf, beyond his ſtrength, in the hot Sunſhine, he began to complain of the pain of his head, a want of Appetite, a heat of his Precordia, and of a Feaveriſh diſtemper all over; to whom, (for that he was wholly averſe to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick) I ordered an abſtinence from all things whatſoever, unleſs from Small-Beer, and Grewel; on the ſecond day, and ſo more on the third, the ſymptoms remitted, by little and little, on the fourth, he went home freed from the Feaver, without any Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>

                     <p>SO much for a Continual Feaver, which is raſied from the moſt ſimple heating of the Blood, or its loweſt degree of inordinate heat; that which depends on a greater degree of heat follows, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Oily or Sulphureous part of the Blood, being too much heated, ſwells up above meaſure, and as it were forced into a flame; and therefore from the ſimilitude, by which humid things putrifying, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an heat, this kind of Ebullition of the Blood, becauſe it induces an immoderate heat, is called a putrid Feaver: which name ought to be retained without injury, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in this Feaver, the Syntheſis of the Blood, (as is wont to happen in putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Liquors) is very much unlocked. When the Spirits only grow inraged, (as in an Ephemera) the frame of the Blood is ſomwhat ſet open, and looſened, that it is more diſſolved, by the Ferment of the Heart, than is wont, and more Particles than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally uſe to do, leap forth, and diffuſe a more intenſe heat; but yet the mixture of the Liquor, as to its chief parts, is conſerved. But when the Sulphureous matter taking fire, grows hot above meaſure, the bond of the mixture, for the greateſt part, is looſed, that its Principles are almoſt wholly drawn away, by the Ferment of the Heart, and the active Particles, being looſned from the mixture, break forth as it were into a flame. Wherefore, the Liquor of the Blood being after this manner rarified, in the Heart, and as it were inkindled, is from thence carried, through the Veſſels, with a moſt rapid motion, and diſperſes very many <hi>Effluvia</hi> of heat, from its deflagration. Hence, the whole maſs of Blood, (like water put over the fire) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually boiling, diſtends the Veſſels, pulls the Brain and Nervous parts, raiſes up Convulſions, and pains in them, very much deſtroys the Vital Spirits with its heat, waſts the Ferments of the Bowels, hinders the Offices of concoction, and diſpenſation, often depraves the nouriſhing Juice, deſtinated for the Nervous ſtock, that from thence exceeding great diſorders of the Animal Spirits follow; yea almoſt perverts the whole oeconomy of Nature.</p>
                     <p>The courſe of this Diſeaſe ſhews it ſelf after this manner; It rarely begins without a procatartic cauſe, or previous diſpoſition: to wit, the Sulphureous or oily part of the Blood, is firſt too much carried forth, and exalted beyond its due tenor, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, either of its own accord, (like Hay not eventilated) begins to grow hot, or by the coming of an evident cauſe, it is forced into a preternatural heat. But when it grows turgid in the firſt place, by reaſon of the admixtion of a crude Juice with the Blood, now a ſhivering, now heat infeſts, which ſhew themſelves unequally, like fire, which is covered with green wood, ſends forth now ſmoak, now flame: But at length, the fire glowing more largely, as here the victor fire ſpreads it ſelf abroad, ſo there (ſooner than ſaid) the whole maſs of Blood is inflamed, and is urged at once with heat, and a moſt ſwift motion: Nor is this immoderate heat of the Blood appeaſed, before its active particles being looſned from the mixture, and then ſucceſſively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled in the Heart, are wholly burned out, which doth not happen, but in the ſpace of many days. And then at length this Feaver ceaſes, when the remaining Liquor of the Blood, the Spirit and Sulphur being very much conſumed, being made lifeleſs and poor, is fit only for a weak and ſmall fermentation. From this kind of deflagration of the Blood, and alſo of the alible Juice, (by the ſame fire burnt out) the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or little Bodies of torrified matter, are heaped up in the Blood; which yet do more promote its fervor, and ebullition, and for a time, increaſe the Feaveriſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. After the Blood hath very much burned forth, and theſe kind of little Bodies, are gathered together to a fulneſs of ſwelling up, the vital Spirit endeavors a ſopara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tries to concoct, and to overcome, (what it may) theſe aduſt recrements, and then, having put a great many of them into a ſwelling up, a Flux being riſen, ſtrives to ſhut them wholly out. And indeed, in the ſubaction, and ſecluſion of this matter, chiefly conſiſts the event of this Diſeaſe; for if the vital Spirit being ſtrong, the Bloody humor (when it hath ſufficiently burned forth, and ſhall be freed from
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:107016:54"/>theſe aduſt particles) ſhould recover its priſtine tenor, whereby it is made fit for moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a due fermentation in the Heart, the ſick tends towards health; but if, by a long deflagration, and an inextricable confuſion of the morbific matter, the liquor of the Blood, being wanting of Spirits, and more pure Sulphur, or thoſe ſame (by the impure mixture growing ill) being as it were put under the yoak; is rendred ſo life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, that it is not any longer rarified, by the ferment of the Heart, or inkindled; by degrees, its heat, and motion, together with Life it ſelf decays.</p>
                     <p>The procatartick cauſes, which diſpoſe to this Diſeaſe, are, an hot and humid Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, an active habit of Body, a youthful Age, the Spring time, or Summer ſeaſon, a high and rich Dyet, beſides the often drinking of rich Wines, a ſedentary and idle life, a Body full of groſs humors, and ſuffed with vitious Juices; but above all the reſt, it appears by obſervation, that the frequent letting of Blood, renders men more apt to Feavers; wherefore it is commonly ſaid, from whom Blood is once drawn, that unleſs they do the ſame every year, they are prone to a Feaver. The reaſon of this is, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I am deceiv'd) by the frequent letting of Blood, the Sulphur is more copiouſly gathered together, in the maſs of Blood; in the mean time, the Salt (which ſhould bridle it, and hinder it from raging) by this means is drawn away; for the Blood, the older it grows, becomes ſo much the more Salt, the Salt of all the Elements not eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating. But by how much the more the Blood abounds in Salt, by ſo much the leſs it aboungs in Sulphur; for Salt eats and conſumes the Sulphur, and makes it evaporate: wherefre, they who are lean, and abound with a Salt Blood, are leſs prone to Feavers. But when, by the letting of Blood, the ancient Blood is drawn forth, in its ſtead another more rich, and more impregnated with Sulphur, is ſubſtituted; ſo that it becomes leſs Salt, and more Sulphurous. Hence it is, that thoſe who often let Blood, are not only prone to Feavers, but alſo wont to grow fat, becauſe of the Bloods being more impregnated with Sulphureous Juice.</p>
                     <p>The evident cauſes, which deduce the latent diſpoſition of this Feaver into act, are of the ſame ſort, which procure an Ephemeran Feaver, and ſimple Synochus; in this rank chiefly come, Tranſpiration being hindred, and Surfeiting. By reaſon of the <hi>effluvia</hi> being reſtrained, the maſs of the Blood being increaſed in bulk grows turgid, and conceives Fervor, as it were from a certain ferment, inſpired anew, and curelly boyls up; from thence, preſently the pores are more obſtructed, by the infartion of the <hi>effluvia,</hi> and the frame of the Liquor being looſned, the particles of the Sulphur, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uberating in the Blood, leap forth from the mixture, and are inflamed by the ferment of the heart, as it were by fire put to them, and ſo they enkindle a very intenſe Feaver. But from a Surfeit, both an immoderate fermentation is induced in the Blood, and alſo a nitrous Sulphureous matter, apt for aduſtion, and an inkindling is conveyed, as it were food, to the burning Blood.</p>
                     <p>In this Feaver, four times or ſeaſons are to be obſerved, in which, as it were ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poſts, or ſpaces, its courſe is performed: Theſe are then, The Beginning, the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, the Height, and Declination. Theſe are wont to be finiſhed in ſome ſooner, in others more ſlowly, or in a longer time. The beginning ought to be computed, from the time the Blood begins to be made hot, and its Sulphur to conceive a burning, until the ardors, and burnings are diffuſed, thorow the whole maſs of Blood. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or Augmentation, is from the time, that the Blood being made hot, and inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led thorow the whole, burns forth for ſome time, and its maſs is aggravated with the Recrements; or burnt Particles, which increaſe the fermentation. The ſtate, or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Diſeaſe, is when (after the Blood has ſufficiently burned forth, and its burning now remits) the long vexed Blood, like a noble wreſtler, when his adverſary is a little yielding, recollecting all his ſtrength, endeavours a bringing under, and a ſeparation of that aduſt matter, with which it is filled to a plenitude, and alſo, a Criſis or ſeparation being once or oftner attempted, an expulſion of it forth of doors. The Declination ſucceeds after the Criſis or ſecretion, in which the Blood grows leſs hot, with a languiſhing fire, and either, (the vital Spirit being as yet ſtrong) overcomes what is left of that aduſt and extraneous matter, and by degrees puts it forth, until it is reſtored to its former vigour; or, whilſt the ſame Spirit is too much depreſſed, the liquor of the Blood, is ſtill ſtuffed with aduſt recrements, and therefore becomes troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and depauperated, that it neither aſſimilates the nouriſhing Juice, nor is made fit for an accenſion in the heart, for the ſuſtaining the lamp of Life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. When therefore any one is taken with a putrid Feaver, the firſt aſſault is for the moſt part accompanied with a ſhivering or horror: for when the Blood begins to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:107016:54"/>grow hot, there is a flux made, and a ſwelling up of the crude Juice, freſhly gathered together in the Veſſels, even as in the fit of an intermitting Feaver, heat, and ſomtimes ſweat follow, upon the ſhivering, by which, the matter of that crude Juice is inkindled, and diſperſed: afterwards, a certain remiſſion of the heat follows, but yet from the fire ſtill glowing in the Blood, a laſſitude, and perturbation with thirſt, and waking, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually infeſt: A pain ariſes in the Head, or Loins, partly from the ebullition of the Blood, and partly from the motion of the nervous Juice being hindred; alſo a nauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, or a vorniting offends the Stomach, becauſe the Bile, flowing out of the Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leduct Veſſels, is poured into it, and a Convulſion from Vapors, and from the ſharp Juice brought thorow the Arteries, is excited in the Stomach. In the mean time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho the heat be more increaſed, and inequal, it is not yet ſtrong, becauſe the Blood as yet abounding with crude Juices, is only inkindled by parts: and therefore burns out a little, and then ceaſes, and at laſt returns; like a flame that is made by wet, and moiſt ſtraw. In this condition for ſome days, the Diſeaſe remains, the Urine is more red than uſual, by reaſon of the Salt, and Sulphur being more diſſolved, and infected with the <hi>ſerum;</hi> It ſtill retains its Hypoſtaſis or ſubſtance, becauſe the Coction and aſſimila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not altogether depraved; it appears greater than ordinary, in its ſediment, which is yet eaſily ſeparated, and falls to the bottom of its own accord. At this time, they may let Blood, and adminiſter Phyſick by Vomit, or Purge, ſo it be done without any great perturbation of the Blood: it often happens, from theſe kinds of evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, timely performed, that a greater increaſe of the Diſeaſe is prevented, and the Feaver as it were killed in the ſhell. The limits of this ſtadium or ſpace, are variouſly determined, according to the temper of the ſick, and other accidents of the Diſeaſe; ſomtimes, the firſt rudiments of this Feaver, are laid in a day or two; ſomtimes the beginning of the Diſeaſe is extended to more; if in a corpulent Body full of Spirit, Juice, and hot Blood, or it happen in a youthful Age, and very hot ſeaſon, if the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a Feaver be potent, and the evident cauſe coming thereupon be ſtrong, the Feaveriſh heat, being once begun, quickly invades all the Blood, and on the ſecond or third day, having rooted it ſelf, the Diſeaſe ariſes to its increaſe; but if the Feaveriſh indiſpoſition, be begun in a leſs hot Body, a Phlegmatic temper, or a melancholy, and in old age, or a cold ſeaſon, the entrance is longer, and ſcarce exceeds the limits of this firſt ſtadium or ſpace, before the ſixth, or ſeventh day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The increaſe of this Diſeaſe, is computed from what time, the burning of the Feaver hath poſſeſt the whole maſs of Blood: that is, the Sulphur, or the oily part of the Blood, having been long heated, and growing fervent in parts, at length, like Hay laid up wet, breaks forth, after a long heating, all at once into a flame; the Blood at this time cruelly boils up, and very much inkindled in the Heart, by its deflagration, diffuſes as it were a fiery heat thorow the whole Body, and eſpecially in the precordia; hence the ſick complain of intolerable thirſt, beſides a pain of the head, pertinacious wakings, and oftentimes a delirium, Phrenſie, and Convulſive motions infeſt: all food whatſoever is loathſom, either it is caſt up again by Vomit, or if retained, being baked by too much heat, it goes into a Feaveriſh matter; beſides, there happens a bitterneſs of the mouth, an ingrateful ſavor, a ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, a vehement and quick Pulſe, an Urine highly red, and for the moſt part troubled, full of Contents, without Hypoſtaſis or laudable ſediment; when the Blood is at this time almoſt wholly inkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by its deflagration, it begets great plenty of aduſt matter, (as it were aſhes remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a Fire) with which the <hi>ſerum</hi> being very much ſtuffed, renders the Urine thick, and big with Contents: Alſo the Blood, being filled with a load of this, to a riſing up, is irritated into Critical motions, by which this Feaveriſh matter, (if it may be done) being brought under, and ſeparated, is ſhut out of doors; and indeed, this ſtate of the Feaver induces that, in which a Judgment is diſcerned, between Nature and the Diſeaſe, the ſtrife being as it were brought to an aequilibrium; and therefore the evacuation, which follows from thence, is called the Criſis.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate therefore, or height of a putrid Feaver, is that time of the Diſeaſe, in which Nature endeavors a Criſis, or an expulſion of the aduſt matter, remaining after the deflagration of the Blood. To this is required, in the firſt place, that the Blood hath now for the moſt part burned forth; becauſe in the midſt of its burning, Nature is not at leiſure for a Criſis, nor is it ever proſperouſly endeavored, nor in truth procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by Art with good Succeſs. Secondly, that the ſpirit of the Blood, doth firſt, by ſome means ſubdue this aduſt matter, or <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> ſeparate it from the profitable, and render a period to the expulſion, for otherways, tho a copious evacuation happens,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:107016:55"/>Nature will never be free from her burthen. Thirdly, that this matter, be gathered together in ſuch a quantity, that by its turgency, it may irritate Nature to a Critical expulſion. If theſe rightly concur, a perfect Criſis of the Diſeaſe, for the moſt part ſucceeds, in which, even as in the Fits of intermitting Feavers, a Flux being ariſen, whatſoever extraneous and heterogeneous thing, is contained in the boſom of the Blood, is exagitated, then being ſeparated, and involved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> it is thruſt forth of doors; when any thing of theſe is wanting, the Criſis, for the moſt part, is in vain, and not to be truſted, and rarely cures the Diſeaſe. For if in the midſt of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before the Blood hath ſufficiently burned forth, an evacuation happens, by Sweat, a Lask, Bleeding, or any other way, the aduſt matter is not all ſeparated, or elſe, if for the preſent, it be drawn away for the greateſt part, the Blood more largely flaming out, preſently ſubſtitutes new, and will renew the Feaver again, that ſeemed to be vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: If that this matter, not being yet overcome, nor brought to a fulneſs of riſing up, be irritated to an expulſion by Nature, an imperfect, and partial Criſis only follows; and when the firſt indeavor of excretion ſhall be in vain, rarely a perfect, and curatory ſucceeds after that one time.</p>
                     <p>The Criſis in a continual Feaver, is almoſt the ſame thing, as the Fit of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Feavers. For as in this, when the maſs of Blood, is filled to a fulneſs of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up, with the particles of depraved alible Juice, and fitted for maturation, there are made a Flux, ſecretion, and expulſion out of doors of that matter: ſo in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Feaver, from the deflagration of the Blood, and alible Juice, very many little Bodies of aduſt matter are gathered together, with which, when the Blood is aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and is at leaſure, a little from the burning, it overcomes them, by little and little ſeparates them, and then a Flux being raiſed up, endeavors to caſt them out of doors: wherefore, as the Fits of intermitting Feavers come not but at a ſet time, and after ſo many hours, ſo alſo the Critical motions, happen from the fourth day to the fourth, or perhaps from the ſeventh day to the ſeventh, for in this kind of ſpace, the Blood being inkindled burns forth, and with its burning makes an heap of aduſt matter, as it were aſhes, which being troubleſom to Nature by their irritation, induces Critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, what ſome affirm is not true, That the Criſes depend altogether on the influences of the Moon, and Stars, and follow their Aſpects, Quadrations, Oppoſitions, or Conjunctions: becauſe the Critical evacuations are only determined, by the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together, and the ſwelling up, of the aduſt matter. For, as ſoon as the Blood is at leaſure, from the deflagration, and being filled with the particle of that aduſt matter, is able in ſome meaſure to overcome, and ſeparate them, preſently a Flux, or ſwelling up being riſen, it endeavors to thruſt them forth by any way; which, for that they are eaſily to be ſeparated from the Blood, and the breathing places of the skin are ſufficiently open, being involved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> are ſent away with ſweat. And this is the beſt way of the Criſis, which if it rightly ſucceeds, very often, wholly, and at one time, perfectly cures the Diſeaſe without danger of relapſe: To this next, follows the Criſis, which which is endeavored by the Hemorrhage or bleeding at noſe; for this matter, as it were the flowring, being moved with the Blood, (if it be not caſt forth by ſweat, by reaſon of a leſs free tranſpiration) is transferred from the heart, into ſome remote part, and frequently is caſt into the head, by the impetuons rapture of the Blood; where, if a paſſage be open, from the private holes opening into the noſtrils, the morbific matter, leaps forth of doors, with a portion of the Blood. But other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways being oftentimes fixed in the Brain, brings a phrenſie, delirium, or other grievous, and tedious Diſeaſes of the head; yea, tis to be obſerved, that almoſt in all continual Feavers whatſoever, when they are hardly or imperfectly cured, ſo that the Blood is infected, for a long time with the Feaveriſh matter or aduſt recrements, that from thence, the nervous Juice (as it ſeems) contracting an infection, pertinacious diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, to wit, watchings, alſo Deliriums, Tremblings, Convulſive motions, and long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering weakneſs of the nervous parts follow. Alſo, there are other ways of Criſis, by which Nature endeavors, not at once and wholly, but by little and little, and by parts, to expel the Feaveriſh matter; now by Urine, now by Vomit, or Stool, now by breakings forth, and buboes, or biles; by what way ſoever, that it may be done with a good event, it is required, that the deflagration of the Blood be paſt, and that the aduſt matter be concocted, and rendered fit to be ſeparated.</p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="tcp:107016:55"/>
                     <p>The ſtate or ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, is therefore not one, and ſimple, nor always happens after the ſame manner, but with a various difference of ſymptoms, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to far different events. But by a prudent Phyſician, a Prognoſtication is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient to be given, in what ſpace of time, the Diſeaſe will come to its height or ſtanding, and what end it will have.</p>
                     <p>If the Feaver be vehement from the beginning, and ſuddenly invades the whole maſs of Blood with a burning; if it urges conſtantly, and equally without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, with a ferocity of ſymptoms; for the moſt part, the Blood will ſo much burn forth, in the ſpace of four days, that the aduſt matter, will ariſe to a fulneſs of ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up, for the making a Criſis. But if its beginnings are more ſlow, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of the Blood often interrupted, the Feaver will come to its <hi>acme</hi> or height, about the ſeventh day. If it ſhould begin yet more remiſs, the ſtanding of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is wont to be drawn out, to the Eleventh or Fourteenth day. In the mean time it is to be noted, that as the Fits of intermitting Feavers return at ſet times, ſo the Critical motions in continual Feavers, (but for the moſt part they obſerve the fourth day:) for altho the Criſis may be perfectly prorogued to the fourteenth, ſeventeenth, or perhaps the twentieth day, becauſe all things, requiſite to the full curing of the Diſeaſe, do not ſooner concur; yet in the time betwixt, more light motions happen, by which the Feaveriſh matter ariſing leiſurely, to an increaſe, is a little emptied, and as it were cut off by parts, until Nature may be able to enter upon its more full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion; but when the great proviſion of the aduſt matter, in the burning Blood, is heaped up in the Veſſels, Nature, unleſs otherways diſturbed, on every fourth day, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tyred with the plenty of matter, trys to ſhake off part of its burthen by a certain ſwelling up: wherefore, for the moſt part, the Critical motions happen on the fourth, ſeventh, eleventh, and fourteenth days, not by the direction of the Planets, but by reaſon of the neceſſity of Nature.</p>
                     <p>As to the event, whether the Criſis ſhall be good or not, certain foreknowledges are taken, from the ſtrength of the ſick, the Pulſe, Urine, and other ſigns, and concourſe of ſymptoms: If the ſick appear with ſome ſtrength, the fire of the Feaver urging, hath a ſtrong and equal Pulſe, if the Urine be of a moderate conſiſtency with ſome ſediment, with a ſeparation of the Contents, and eaſily falling to the bottom, if the Diſeaſe ſhall make its progreſs, without great Vomiting, Watchings, Phrenſie, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions, and ſuſpition of malignity, the ſtanding will be laudable, and to be expected with a good Criſis: if the contrary to theſe happen, <hi>viz.</hi> that preſently ſtrength is caſt down, and that the ſick is obnoxious to frequent Swoonings, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, a delirium, with a weak intermitting or unequal Pulſe, if pertinacious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, intollerable thirſt, and Vomiting continually infeſt; if the Urine be thick and troubled, without ſediment, or ſinking down of the parts, if, the burning yet troubling, Nature is provoked to critical evacuations, a very dangerous ſtate of the Diſeaſe is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, nor may there be hoped for any thing of good from the Criſis.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Criſis of a Putrid Feaver, we will here ſubjoyn a particular Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtication, in which, though the things, which from the beginning did appear, might promiſe a moſt deſired event, a very deadly one is imminent; I have often obſerved, in a Putrid Feaver, which begins ſlowly, and with a ſmall burning, if the Urine be red, and when rendred preſently troubled, and thick, which is not precipitated, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the cold, nor of its own accord, puts down a ſediment, and if at the ſame time, the ſick lie for many days without ſleep, tho quiet, and that they toſs not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up and down, their condition is in danger: and the ſuſpition will be more, if in the mean time, they are neither troubled with a ſtrong Feaver, nor infeſted with thirſt, or with a very troubleſom heat; becauſe thoſe diſtempered after this manner, are incident for the moſt part, about the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, to a delirium, Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive motions, and oftentimes fall into madneſs, from which they are quickly caſt into death; an when theſe ſymptoms ariſe, the Urine is altered, from a thick and red, into a thin and more pale Urine. It ſeems in this caſe, the maſs of Blood, beink taken with the Feaver, not to grow turgid, ſo with Sulphur exalted to the height, as Wines or Beer are wont in their Efferveſcencies; but (the Salt, and the terreſtrial Lee or Dregs, being ſtirred together with the Sulphur) to be affected after the ſame way, as Wines and Beer, being ſuddenly diſturbed with Thunder, and growing ſour; wherefore, altho the Blood does not preſently conceive an immoderate heat from the Feaver, yet its diſpoſition being changed, it wholly depraves the Juice deſtinated to the Brain, and Nervous parts, and therefore, about the beginning of the Feaver, pertinacious watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:107016:56"/>happen, then the ſtate growing urgent, the oeconomy of the whole Nervous ſtock is perverted. Melancholic perſons are moſt obnoxious to theſe ſort of Feavers, in whom the unrulineſs of the Sulphur, are a little reſtrained, by the Salt, and Earthy dregs being ſtirred up with it, notwithſtanding which, all being leiſurely carried forth, break forth afterwards, with a greater ſlaughter.</p>
                     <p>When the Diſeaſe ſhall come to the ſtanding, either the buſineſs is done at one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and from thence with a manifeſt declination, there is made a tranſlation to life, or death, or there are made frequent skirmiſhes, between Nature and the Diſeaſe, and critical motions are often attempted, before the victory is yielded to either party.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, If after the Blood hath ſufficiently burned forth, with a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion of ſigns and ſymptoms, and its burning hath remitted, the aduſt matter being equally brought under, and ſubtilated, ariſes from a full increaſe, to the motion of boiling up; and Nature being free from any impediment or depreſſion, is ſtrong with able ſtrength enough, for the decertation or ſtrife, the Feaveriſh matter, for the moſt part, is exterminated at one motion of its flowring or putting forth, and the Blood being freed from its fellowſhip and infection, ſoon recovers its former vigour.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But if Nature is ſtirred up, to a critical motion, before the Blood hath perfectly burnt forth, or that aduſt matter is prepared for excretion, altho, as to the reſt, things are in a moderate condition; yet from hence, but an imperfect Criſis follows, by which indeed, ſomthing of the lead or burthen, with which the Blood is oppreſſed, is drawn away; notwithſtanding preſently another ſprings up afreſh, in its place, and then at ſet times, (perhaps in four, or ſeven days ſpace) like the fits of intermitting Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, the critical motions are repeated, the ſecond, and perhaps the third time, before the ſtrife being ended, the matter openly inclines to this, or that party.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But when, with the preceeding evil appearance, of ſigns and ſymptoms, the burning of the Blood yet urging, the critical motion is provoked, without any coction of the Feaveriſh matter, ſomtimes Nature is overthrown at the firſt conflict, nor doth ſhe recollect herſelf, but yielding her powers overcome by the Diſeaſe, is precipitated into death. Nor is the buſineſs much better, when the Criſis is at firſt imperfect, and in vain, celebrated, without any eaſe to the ſick, and from thence, the next to this ſucceeds worſe, and then in another, and perhaps another conflict, the Diſeaſe prevails, until the ſtrength being wholly broken, and caſt down, there is a plain end of life.</p>
                     <p>Thus much concerning the ſtate and Criſis of the Diſeaſe, on whoſe good or improſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſucceſs, the event of the Diſeaſe depends; the declination of the Feaver, takes its period of this, of which we muſt ſpeak next.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Altho the Declining of the Feaver, for the moſt part, is taken in the better part, that it denotes the condition of the ſick growing well of the Diſeaſe, in which the Blood being almoſt freed from its Effervency, recovers leiſurly, ſtrength and ſpirits, that were loſt, and expels what extraneous thing is left remaining in its boſom; yet, in a genuine enough ſignification, it may be uſed for that ſtate, when from an ill Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, or in vain, the Blood being depauperated, and infected with an extraneous and Feaveriſh mixture, ſtill declines for the worſe, until at length (like Wine changed into a lifeleſſneſs) being made wholly unable for circulation, and accenſion in the Heart, it calls on death. Therefore, in this place, the name of declination ſignifies the condition of the ſick, and of the Diſeaſe, which follows the ſtanding, whether it tends to life, or to death; whether the Feaver, or life it ſelf of the ſick, at this time, declines.</p>
                     <p>As to the times of declination, it will be worth our labour to inquire, what the temper of the Blood may be, and what turns of alterations it has undergone, as often as from a good, or bad Criſis, there has been made a progreſs of the Diſeaſe, towards Health, or Death. To wit, firſt, what the diſpoſition, or condition of the Blood and Spirits may be, from a good Criſis, and with what alterations, its ſpoiled Liquor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers its former vigor. Secondly, what their temper is, from an evil Criſis, and by what degrees it ſtill tends to worſe; and laſtly, how they are, when from a doubtful ſtate, and long weakneſs, the ſick hardly get up at length, and recover their health.</p>
                     <p>The vice, or depauperation, which the Blood hath contracted from the Feaveriſh heat, conſiſts in this: The Spirit very much evaporates, and is loſt: the Sulphureous part is too much ſcorched, and is much waſted by the deflagration, and from its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the aduſt matter (as it were the <hi>Caput Mortuum</hi>) is left, with the Particles of which, the maſs of Blood is aggravated, and debilitated; in the mean time, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and earthy parts, are too much exalted, even as is wont to come to paſs in Wine, or Beer, by the uſe of too much Ferment. The Blood, by theſe ways being ſpoiled,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:107016:56"/>evilly aſſimilates the proviſion of the Nutritious Juice, yea alſo, by reaſon of the roaſting of the Sulphur in the Heart, or defect of it, not rightly Fermenting, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, it untowardly diſpenſes the Vital Spirit, in the mean time, from the aduſt matter, and Salt too much exalted, it grows more fervent than it ſhould, and more waſts it ſelf.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. From a good Criſis, the Spirit, tho made weaker, yet gets the upper hand, wherefore, what is left of the Feaveriſh matter, it by degrees overcomes, and expels; and concocts, and affimilates (ſo what is brought be thin or ſlender) the Nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Juice: from thence, the maſs of Blood is amended anew, with Spirit and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur; and the Blood which now being Salt and ſharp, did continually grow hot, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires at length a Sweet and Balſamic Nature, and being quickned with a lively mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and heat, rightly performs the offices of life and ſenſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. From a bad Criſis, the buſineſs is otherways, the Liquor of the Blood (like Wine too much Fermented) degenerates, almoſt into a vappidneſs or lifeleſſneſs; its Spirit is greatly deminiſhed; the Reliques which remain, are intricated, and as it were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, with the Particles of aduſt matter, from whence there is yet a continual growing hot remaining in the Blood, yet without concoction, or aſſimilation, of the Abible Juice, or ſeparation of the profitable, from the unprofitable: The benign Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur, and the Food of the Vital flame, is much conſumed, ſo that the Blood is leſs inkindled in the Heart, than it ought to be; in the mean time; from the aduſt recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and alſo the Salt, and Earth being too much carried forth, it perpetually burns in the Veſſels, with thirſt and heat. And becauſe it is dayly depauperated, the Spirit and benign Sulphur being waſted, and more infected, with the Salt, and Earthy dregs being too much exalted, its Liquor in a ſhort time becomes taſtleſs, and is made unfit for circulation, and for the inkindling in the Heart, for the ſuſtaining the Vital fire: wherefore there is a neceſſity that life be loſt, even as the flame of a Lamp is extinguiſhed, when inſtead of the waſted Oil, a Salt and Muddy Liquor only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. From an imperfect and doubtful Criſis, when the ſick being weakned by a long imbecillity, become not well, but of a long time, the buſineſs is after this manner. The Spirituous and Sulphureous parts of the Blood, are very much conſumed, by the ſlow deflagration; the remaining Liquor, being not Purged from the aduſt recrements and feculencies, is rendred very impure; but when there is yet remaining, ſomthing of Oil for the Vital Lamp, nor Spirits are altogether wanting, for the ſubduing the Feaveriſh matter, the Blood is ſtill circulated, and (tho but ſmally) is inkindled in the Heart: yea, and by little and little the Spirits recollect themſelves, ſet upon the matter remaining of the Feaver, and what they are able, begin to overcome it: then by a pertinacious aſſiduity, or coction, like a flame, wavering and half extinct, among green wood, at length riſe up victorious, and reſtore anew, both with heat and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leiſurely renewed, a quick and lively Fermentation, in the Heart.</p>
                     <p>So much in general of the Feaver called Putrid: it remains, before we deſcend to the kinds, and particular Caſes of it, that I recount the ſymptoms, and ſigns chiefly notable, in the courſe of this Feaver, and ſubjoyn the reaſons, and cauſes of them, and their manner of being done.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the Symptoms, and Signs chiefly to be noted, in a Putrid Feaver.</head>
                     <p>THE Symptoms, coming upon a Putrid Feaver, altho they argue, the oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the whole Body, to be for the moſt part depraved, and the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and functions of ſome part, or Member hurt; yet, the accidents, which a Phyſician ought chiefly to conſider, about the Diagnoſis of this Diſeaſe, and its Prognoſis to be rightly inſtituted, may be referred to three caſſes or common places; to wit, they have reſpect to the Viſcera of Concoction, <hi>viz.</hi> the Ventricle, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:107016:57"/>with their Appendixes: Or ſecondly, to the humours, flowing in the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood in the Arteries and Veins, and the thin Liquor in the Nervous parts, together with the chief ſprings of either, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heart, and Brain; or laſtly, theſe ſymptoms reſpect the habit of the Body, with the various conſtitution of the pores, and the extenſion or emarceration of the ſolid parts. They, who would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly obſerve, the courſe of this Diſeaſe, and would fitly draw out Curatory intentions, may take notice of theſe three heads of ſymptoms, and carefully conſider, what altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may happen in theſe, as it were diſtinct Regions, according to the different times of the Feaver.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Troubles, and diſorders, ſuch as nauſeouſneſs, vomiting, want of Appetite, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſtion, a looſeneſs, a ſcurfineſs of the Mouth and Tongue, a bitter ſavour, are wont to infeſt about the Ventricle, and firſt paſſages, in the whole courſe of this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. Theſe, for the moſt part, are attributed to the humors, firſt heaped together in the Stomach, and there putrifying: But beſides, that the recrements of the Chyle, being throughly roaſted, by too much heat, degenerate into an hurtful matter, very often, theſe kind of accidents happen, for that the Purgings, and the filth of the Blood, and Nervous Juice, whilſt they grow hot, are carried inward, and being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited in the membranes of the Viſcera, provoke Convulſions, and alſo make a filthy heap of vitious, and very infeſtous humor. I have often obſerved, that about the beginning of the Feaver, the Blood growing hot, laid aſide its recrements even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, with a benefit to the ſick, where, altho great moleſtations did ariſe about the firſt paſſages, yet the burning was therefore more mild, the Pulſe moderate, and the Urine laudable, and theſe being after this manner in a Feaver, quickly grew well, with a ſlender diet, and the uſe of gentle evacuations. But if in this caſe I ſhould admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter a vehement Cathartic, for the extirpating the humours, that Natural Purging of the Blood being hindred, preſently the Feaver became ſtrong, with a red Urine, and troubled, a deep Pulſe, Watchings, and other horrid ſymptoms: alſo, oftentimes after the ſtate of the Diſeaſe, by this kind of interior Luſtration or Purging, the aduſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and excrementitious, is ſeparated from the Blood. Hence, ſomtimes a Lask, ſomtimes a ſcurfie covering of the Mouth and Throat, follow: Wherefore, there is need of caution, about the accidents which happen in the firſt paſſages, leſt that whilſt we oppoſe them, we ſhould pervert the motion of Nature; and leſt whilſt we fortifie theſe parts, againſt the courſe of the Morbific matter, we untowardly keep the ſame ſhut up, in the maſs of Blood.</p>
                     <p>The Symptom chiefly to be conſidered, about the Bloody maſs, are, an heat dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed through the whole, a burning of the Praecordia, thirſt, a diſorder of the Pulſe, a red ruine, a ſpontaneous weariſomneſs, a loſs of all ſtrength, out of which rightly conſidered, theſe things following may be known, <hi>viz.</hi> what the manner of the heat is, or with what tenour the burning Blood flames forth; what times of remiſſion, or of increaſe, its Efferveſcency obſerves, in the deflagration; whether it retains its Craſis, or mixture whole; for the burning of it, and circulation of it inkindled, what ſtrength of the Heart will ſuffice, and what ſpace the Veſſels may require; ſo long as the Blood burns, what plenty of aduſt recrements it may heap up, by what means it may overcome, ſeparate, or at leſt endeavour to ſeparate the ſame, and laſtly, what way of a Criſis it endeavours, and with what ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>The accidents, which have a reſpect to the thin Liquor, with the Brain, and Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Appendix, are, diſorders concerning ſleep and waking, a debility of the whole Body, a trembling, ſhivering, pains, Convulſive motions, Cramps of the Viſcera, Stupifaction, Phrenſie; and the obſervation of which ſuggeſts, what the temper, and conſtitution of that thin Liquor may be; by what means it waters, and influtes the Nervous parts, and performs its circutes through them; how the Animal Spirits execute the functions of the Viſcera; what the ſtate of the Brain may be, whether it remain free from the incurſion of the Feaveriſh matter, or whether it be not in danger of being overwhelmed, by reaſon of its critical metaſtaſis or tranſlation.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the habit of the body may be obſerved, what may be the reaſon of ſweating, and the manner of it; whether only by vaporous <hi>Effluvia?</hi> or by ſweats? or alſo by little wealks! whether the fleſh falls away on the ſudden from its wonted bulk? Or whether it retains it ſelf a long while? What the colour of the Face is! And the vigor or habit of the Eyes? from theſe well laid together, the courſe of the Feaver may be beſt of all meaſured; at what time it will come to its hight or ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Whether Nature will prevail over the Diſeaſe or not; with what manner of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:107016:57"/>and with what ſucceſs ſhe will endeavor the expulſion of the Feaveriſh mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; alſo by theſe ſigns may be learned, by what degrees the Blood growing hot, and often congealed, doth tend towards Putrefaction, or Corruption; whether it does any thing concoct the alible Juice poured to it; or whether or not it preſently caſts forth of doors, all its proviſion by ſweat, as often happens in the declination of this Diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>By theſe ſymptoms and ſigns, a yet more plentiful Indication may be had, if firſt it be known, upon what cauſes the ſeveral ſpecies of them depend; and by what provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they are wont to be raiſed up in our Body: wherefore I have thought it worth our labour to recount particularly the chief of theſe; and to explicate the reaſons of them, and their ways of working. But the ſymptoms, chiefly to be obſerved in a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Synochus, or continual ſervor without intermiſſions, are, an heat in the whole Body, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, a burning of the Precordia, intolerable thirſt, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, or Jawes, a pain of the head and loins, pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous watchings, Phrenſie, Convulſive motions, a Syncope, Heart-burning, Vomiting, Nauſeouſneſs, want of Appetite, a Looſneſs, a Flux, with which, not all at once, now with theſe, now with thoſe, this Diſeaſe is wont to be beſet.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Heat, which is felt ſharp and biteing, in the whole Body, depends upon the too great effervency of the Blood, and the accenſion of it in the Heart: For the Sulphureous or oily part of the Blood, being exalted, and taking an heat, is inkindled in the heart, in a double proportion, more than it was wont; wherefore, it copiouſly diffuſes, by its deflagration, <hi>effluvia</hi> of heat thorow the whole Body. When the Sulphur is leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and inkindled in the heart, as in the green ſickneſs, or the white dropſical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Heat is wanting in the whole: but in a Feaver, when te Sulphur too much burns forth, Heat ſuperabounds. For heat, depends not only upon the actual infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Sulphur, or the firing of it, but an intenſe heat is excited without fire, in many mixtures, where the particles of Sulphur are diſſolved by corroſion, or are more thickly heaped together for want of ventilation; wherefore, when Iron is corroded by any acid mineral Spirit, or when Spirit of Nitre is poured on the butter of Antimony, a mighty heat with a fume is produced; in like manner when Dung, or Hay laid up wet, are kept from ventilation, grow highly hot: it is the ſame reaſon, why the Blood burns above meaſure in Feavers, to wit, the particles of the Sulphur, being too much exalted and made hot, are more thickly heaped together in the Veſſels, and are more diſſolved, and as it were inkindled by the ferment of the Heart; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, they every way diffuſe heat, being looſned in the bond of the mixture, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where ſtretched forth or expanſed.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A ſpontaneous wearineſs or laſſitude, is felt in the whole Body: to wit, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Veſſels being diſtented with the boiling Blood, alſo the muſculous fleſh is very much ſtuffed with Blood, and a copious breath, that it is made leſs fit for motion, as they who are ſick of an Anaſarca, have their limbs very unwealdy by reaſon of the aboundance of ſerous humor: beſides, in Feavers, by reaſon of the inflamation of the Blood, the Juice, which is ſent for a ſupply to the nervous ſtock, departs from its due temper, that it becomes little fit, for the actuating the Body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. The burning of the Praecordia is made, by reaſon of the Blood being more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly enkindled in the Chimny of the Heart, which from thence boiles forth into the Lungs, with great ardency; wherefore, by how much the neerer this Region is to that fire place of heat, it is pierced therefore with the greater burning.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. An almoſt unquenchable Thirſt is cauſed, both from the glowing heat in the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, alſo by reaſon of the ſharp and hot particles of the Feaveriſh matter, affixed to the ventricle, in the circulating of the Blood; which indeed, deſire to be waſhed, even as ſalted and ſpiced meats, being plentifully eaten, or alſo ſtrong, or ſour things, rouled in the mouth, or throat; for this kind of diſtemper, calls for a more free ſwallowing down of Drink, as a member too much heated the pouring on of cold water.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The ardor, and ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, and Jawes, as alſo oftentimes an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of a certain white, or yellow, or black filth, happen without doubt, becauſe of the heat, and ſoot, exhaled frmm the Ventricle, and Lungs, burning with heat: but the Tongue grows white, as often as that humidity, (with which it is naturally much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bued) is dried up, and parched, and ſo the exterior skin of the Tongue, is as it were roaſted, by the burning heat, from hence alſo it becomes ſcurfie; which is alſo ſeen in healthful people, when it happens, that the Tongue is ſcorched by broth, or any other very hot ſuppings; in like manner, as when the Tongues of Animals are boiled, for the uſe of the Table, their skin becomes white and ſharp or rugged. For whether the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:107016:58"/>ſpittle is drawn from the maxillary glandulas, (as the doctrine of the moſt ingenious <hi>Wharton</hi> hath firſt made known) or any other humor from the glandulas of the Jawes, or elſewhere; yet becauſe, by the reaſon of the heat, and dryneſs, it grows too thick, and becomes clammy, alſo then the outward skin of the Tongue grows nevertheleſs white; but alſo it is covered with a certain filthy glew, to wit, becauſe that humor, by reaſon of its thickneſs, may ſmear the Tongue, but cannot wet, or moiſten it: but if it happens, that the Tongue is inwardly ſuffuſed, with a bilous humor, or outwardly tinged (as comes to paſs by the uſe of Choler-abounding Vomits) then its hairy nap, being ſpongy, imbibing the yellow poyſon, exhibits alſo the like colour. If that laſtly, the heat be ſo ſtrong, that it burns the Blood, and inkindles a fire, more ardent than uſual, it follows, that from the fire place of the Heart, the breathing places through the Lungs, ſcarcely ſufficing for the ventilating ſo great fire, ſoot or ſmoak is raiſed up, which being ſmitten to the furnace of the Pallat, ſtrikes againſt the Tongue, as it were in a reverberatory, and infects it with blackneſs. But this ſame kind of blackneſs, (ans as other filthineſſes of the Tongue) is moſt conſpicuous in its middle parts, becauſe the more exterior compaſs, is cleanſed by its frequent rubbing againſt the gums and palate.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Somtimes it happens in Feavers, and eſpecially about their declinations, that the Tongue, palat, gums, yea the cavity of the whole mouth, and throat, are covered over with a certain viſcous matter, as it were a whitiſh cruſt; which being often wiped off, preſently new ſprings again, and unleſs by rubbing diligently, and waſhing the mouth, this cruſty matter be frequently wiped away, the ſick are in hazard of being choaked. This kind of diſtemper, is moſt often excited in Children newly born; for they are wont, for the moſt part, within fourteen days with an external growing hot, to be ſprinkled thorow the whole skin, with broad and red ſpots; if that this ſuffuſion of redneſs, do not freely break forth, or vaniſhes away ſooner than it ought, for the moſt part, this whitiſh curſt follows, in the parts of the mouth. This ſymptom, when it troubles Infants, after this manner, is wont to be aſcribed to the fault of the Milk, to wit, that being to ſharp, it induces the ulcerous diſtemper of the mouth. In thoſe ſick with Feavers, it is commonly attributed to thick vapors, and ſoottie, elevated from the ventricle: But to me it ſeems moſt likely, that in either, this diſtemper ariſes, from the impurities of the whole Blood, (and perhaps in ſome meaſure of the nervous Juice) depoſited about theſe parts: for, as often as in the maſs of either humor, any extraneous thing intimately mixed, is contained, that it is not to be diſperſed by ſweat, nor eaſily ſent away by Urine, that, moſt often, is fixed, with the ſerous filth about the mouth; from whence Catarrhs, tumors, and troubleſom ſpittings are cauſed: For when for the chewing of the meats, the ſalival humor in this place ought to be plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffuſed; nature very often endeavors to ſend forth of doors, what is ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or otherways troubleſome, by theſe uſual ways of excretion. Hence from <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury</hi> being taken, when both the Blood, and nervous Juice, are abundantly ſtuffed, with its moſt ſmally divided particles, and endeavor to thruſt them forth, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved with <hi>ſerum,</hi> becauſe they are not able to exterminate thoſe mercurial little Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, being intimately confuſed, neither by ſweat, urine, or by any other ways, what is remaining, they endeavor to expel thorow the Arteries, and other paſſages, which ſupply the mouth with ſpittle, the ſame being involved with the ſerous Latex. Alſo in like manner, in Feavers, when from a long deflagration of the Blood, the aduſt matter is very much heaped together, of which no ſmall part remaining, after the Criſis, is yet confounded with the Blood, and nervous Juice, being fixed either to the brain, or to ſome other place, from them it is at length ſupped up again, 'tis moſt probable, that this matter, is throughly roaſted, by a long concoction, and ſo becomes almoſt like Glew, thick, wherefore, being not able to be diſperſed, neither by ſpittle, or inſenſible tranſpiration, nor to be ſeparated by the urinarie paſſages, but at length leiſurely runs out, by the little Arteries, and other paſſages of the ſpittle, lying open into the Palat, as the moſt uſual way of excretion, and forthwith by reaſon of its thickneſs grows into that glewineſs. The ſame reaſon holds in Infants, whoſe Blood being made im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, by filths contracted in the Womb, preſently it endeavors to purifie it ſelf, by that exterior putting forth, which if it do not rightly ſucceed, by reaſon of the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the matter, immediatly the viſcous impurities, are exterminated by this way, as the more open. I have known ſome, in the declination of a Feaver, to whom, not only this kind of Cruſt of gummy matter, has hapned in the parts of the mouth, but a copious ſalivation, as if they had taken mercury, with a ſtinking of the breath,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:107016:58"/>alſo a ſwelling of the Tongue, and Gums, hath been raiſed up for many days.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. The pain of the Head, in Feavers is excited, becauſe of the Meninges of the Brain, being pulled or hauled with vapors, and with a ſharp Blood, and hot; for the Blood being impetuouſly moved, by reaſon of the direction of the great Arterie, is carried in a greater plenty to the Head, than to the lower parts; becauſe the paſſage, from the boſom of the Heart to the head, is ſtrait, from the ſame, to the inferior mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, oblique, and as it were reflected; wherefore, as the membranes are very ſenſible, and that there the Blood is ſtopped, and reverberated, in its rapid courſe, it is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if cruel headaches are excited in Feavers. Beſides, this impetuous flowing of the Blood, wherewith (as it were by a certain Ramming) the membranes of the Head be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtended, ake grievouſly; alſo ſomtime, Headaches ariſe, by reaſon of the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Juice, (which is ſupplyed from the burning Blood) being too ſharp, and prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: wherefore, when the membranes, and nervous parts, are watered, with the ſame, they being pulled by its acrimony, are moved into Pains and Convulſions.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. In like manner alſo, the other diſtempers of the Head, as watchings, delirium, Phrenſie, Convulſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ariſe, ſomtimes from the Blood being in a rage, and ſo ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up inordinate motions in the Brain, and ſomtimes alſo, from the nervous Juice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing depraved, and therefore made inproportionate, to the regiment of the Animal Spirits: But moſt often, theſe kind of ſymptoms are frequent in Feavers, by reaſon of the tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter, from the boſom of the Blood, into theſe parts. For the Blood, being full of the aduſt recrements, remaining after the deflagration, endeavors (like the flowring of new Wine) to ſubdue, and exclude them from its Company, by every manner of way; which, a Flux being ariſen, when it cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by Sweat, Urine, or bleeding, it oftentimes tranfers, to the ſubſtance of the Brain, and there fixes them: and from hence chiefly, the aforſaid diſtempers, when they are fixed, and firmly rooted, draw their original, when as the lighter, and that are eaſily moved, often proceed from the afore-recited cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. Convulſive motions, happen in Feavers, for divers cauſes: ſomtimes, becauſe of the matter being heaped together in the firſt paſſages, which there haules the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous parts, with its notable pravity, and then, by the conſent of the nervous ſtock, the Convulſion is preſently Communicated to the beginning of the Nerves, in the Brain, and by that means draws aſide now theſe, and now thoſe parts: by which means, Worms abounding in the Viſcera, ſharp humors being ſtirred, and ſtrong Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, induce Convulſions: or ſecondly, when the Feaver, is a partaker of ſome malignity, ſo in the ſmall Pox, Meaſels, or the Plague frequently Convulſions happen; to wit, becauſe the Blood is altered, from its benign and natural temper, into a deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and venomous, by which the Nerves, and their beginnings, are pierced, and forced into Convulſions. Alſo, oftentimes without the ſuſpition of malignity, in a putrid Feaver, Convulſive motions are induced, by reaſon of the tranſlation of the Feave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh matter, to the Brain, as was but now intimated: ſo I have often obſerved, when the Diſeaſe is not preſently cured with the Criſis, the ſick ly by it, with a tedious ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are made obnoxious to tremblings, and Convulſive motions. Thirdly, and laſtly, for the moſt part in every Feaver, which terminates in Death, Convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are the ſad forerunners of it; which I think to happen, not only from the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the matter, with which the nervous ſtock is pulled and pierced, but becauſe the Spirits, very much exhauſted and debilitated, do not ſufficiently blow up, and diſtend the Bodies of the Nerves, wherefore, being releaſed from their wonted extenſion, and tonick motion, they are however by a more weak indeavor of the Spirits, agitated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a diſordered motion.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. A ſyncope or ſwooning, is wont to be raiſed up ſeveral ways in Feavers, but chiefly for theſe three cauſes, to wit, either from the mouth of the Ventricle being diſtempered, which part, as it is interwoven with a manifold texture of Nerves, is very ſenſible, and becauſe from the ſame branch of the ſixth pare, little ſhoots of Nerves, are equally derived to the heart, and to the Ventricle, of the Orifice of the Ventricle, ſo implanted with Nerves, be diſtempered, with any great trouble, it is alſo Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the heart, and either the motion is ſtopped in it, or at leaſt an inordinate one is excited, whereby the equal Flux of the Spirits, and the Blood, is interrupted for a time. I knew one in an acute Feaver, taken with a frequent ſwooning, which diſtemper wholly ceaſed, after he had caſt forth by Vomit, a long and ſmooth Worm. Secondly, a ſyncope alſo, is ſomtimes induced, becauſe the invenomed matter is circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:107016:59"/>with the Blood, which ſuddenly fixes, and extinguiſhes the vital Spirits, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geals the Blood it ſelf, that it is apt to ſtagnate in the heart, as uſually happens in the Peſt, ſmall Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak particularly hereafter. Thirdly, a ſyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope is wont to happen, by reaſon of the more rare texture of the Spirits, which as they are very tender and ſubtil, are eaſily unbent, by any immoderate motion or pain: ſo I have known ſome, who being quiet in bed, have found themſelves well enough, but being removed from one place to another, preſently have ſwooned away.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. The pain of the Heart happens in Feavers, when the Ventricle, and eſpecially its Orifices, by reaſon of the manifold inſertions of Nerves, being very ſenſible, are beſet with a ſharp and bitteriſh humor, or elſe with an acid, and corroſive; for hence a pain and trouble ariſes from the acrimony of the humor, after the ſame manner, as when the ſphincter of the fundament is afflicted, in Cholloric dejections, with pain and moleſtation.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. By reaſon of the ſame cauſe, Vomiting, and nauſeouſneſs are wont to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, to wit, by the Ventricles being beſet, and irritated to a Convulſion, from an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous matter, and not akin to it ſelf: Such an excrementitious matter, may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the Ventricle, by three ways; for either the aliments, partly by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a want of an acid ferment, by which they ſhould be rightly Cooked, and partly by reaſon of the burning heat of the Ventricle, are roaſted into ſuch a Corruption; or Secondly, this kind of matter, is laid up in the Ventricle, from the Arteries, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in its Cavity, as uſes to happen in the ſmall Pox, the Plague, and malignant Feavers; or Thirdly, meer Choler, being preſſed forth from the Choleduct Veſſels, into the empty inteſtine, by reaſon of an inverſe motion, and as it were Convulſive, of that inteſtine, it is poured into the Ventricle, want of Appetite, alſo happens, by reaſon of the Ventricles abounding with vitious Juices, and becauſe the acid ferment, is wholly perverted, by the ſcorching heat. Theſe kind of diſtempers of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle, and Viſcera, ſomtimes ariſe from an excrementitious matter, (to wit, alimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, degenerated in the concoction) heaped together, a long while before the Feaver, in the firſt paſſages, which not ſeldom becomes, the occaſional cauſe, of the Feaver it ſelf: but ſomtimes, nauſeouſneſs, want of Appetite, Vomiting, pain of the Heart <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are the immediate products of the Feaver; for when the day before the ſickneſs, thoſe diſtempered, have been well enough in their Stomack, as ſoon as the immoderate heat of the Blood was induced, whilſt it boiled up above meaſure, both the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and the recrements, being wonted to be evaporated outwardly, alſo the bilous humor, flowing out of the Choleduct Veſſels, are poured into the Ventricle; by which, its Craſis is overthrown; alſo the Reliques of the Chyle, and other contents in the Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera, are egregiouſly depraved; from whence, the aforeſaid Diſtempers draw their Original.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. No leſs frequent a ſymptom in Feavers, is a Diarrhea, or Flux of the Belly, which ſomtime happens about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, and ariſes (for the moſt part) either from the Bile, flowing forth of the Coleduct Veſſels, into the <hi>Duodenum;</hi> or from the recrements of the Blood, and Nervous Juice, poured forth from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, and the paſſage of the Pancreas, into the inteſtines. All the aforeſaid humors, (but eſpecially the Choleric) when they are ſupplied in abundance, often Ferment with the maſs remaining of the Chyme, that the ſame ſwelling up with a ſpumous rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, irritates the inteſtines, and provokes to the motion of excretion: ſomtimes alſo, about the ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, and in the declination of it, a Lask is exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and ſo, either Nature being Conquereſs, the more thick purgings of the Blood, are this way critically ſifted forth; or being overcome, the Flux of the Belly, is the effect, and ſign, of the Viſcera wholly loſing their ſtrength, and firm tenour. It ſomtimes happens in a Feaver, that the Belly is always bound, that it is not at all looſned, but by Phyſick, and tho the ſick take nothing but liquid things, for many days, the ſtools are ſtill of a ſolid conſiſtence, and hard, this ſeems for the moſt part to be done, when the Blood growing ſharply and exceeding hot, like fire, conſumes the humidities, wherever they flow, and draws to it ſelf, out of the Bowels, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery matter, by a Copious emiſſion of vapours, and preſently makes it to be evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated outwardly: wherefore, the thicker part, being left in the inteſtines, is made firm, from the ſcorching heat as it were a <hi>Caput Mortuum,</hi> remaining after diſtillation.</p>
                     <p>A Dyſſentery is a diſtemper, ſo frequent in continual Feavers, that ſome years it becomes Epidemical, and not more mild than the Plague kills many: The cauſe of it is wont to be, not any humor produced within in the Viſcera, that corrodes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:107016:59"/>with its Acrimony, (as ſome affirm) but a certain infection impreſſed on the Blood, and ſo intimately confuſed with it, that, under the form of a vapour, or a ſincere humor, it cannot be pulled away from the Blood: wherefore, the thruſting forwards, towards the inteſtines, unlocks the little mouths of the Arteries, and makes there little Ulcers, and exudations or flowings forth of the Blood, like as when from the Feaveriſh Blood, Puſtles and inflamations break forth outwardly, with a flowring towards the skin: But it is moſt likely, theſe dyſenteric diſtempers, which accompany Malignant, or Epidemical Feavers, ariſe from a certain coagulation of the Blood, as ſhall be more fully declared hereafter.</p>
                     <p>And here alſo, among the ſymptoms of Feavers, might be recited, what are wont to appear outwardly, in the ſuperficies of the Body, as are Spots, Whelks, Buboes, Carbuncles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but becauſe theſe belong after an eſpecial manner to a Malignant Feaver, therefore we will forbear in this place, from the conſideration of them, until we ſhall ſpeak of the Plague, Small-pox, the Peſtilential, and Malignant Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The Pulſe and Urine ſhall conclude here the troop of ſymptoms and ſigns in a Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Feaver, which are much heeded, for the finding out, both the ſtate and the ſtrength of the ſick: For, as there are two things, by which our life is propped, <hi>viz.</hi> Heat inkindled in the Heart, and concoction to be made in the Viſcera, and Veſſels, becauſe the Pulſe and Urine, beſt ſhow the alterations in either, induced in a Feaver, therefore from hence, a moſt certain judgment is taken of this Diſeaſe, about to end, in Death or Health. I think it is not needful, to ſpeak of theſe at large, or to recount the ſeveral cauſes and differences of either: It will ſuffice for me to note here, the chiefeſt things of them, and what are worthy of conſideration in the courſe of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. And firſt of all the Pulſe is conſulted, as it were a Thermometer or Weather-Glaſs, conſtitued by Nature, that from thence, the heat inkindled, in a Feaver might be meted; which if it ſhould be more ſtrong, ſtirs up a great ebullition or boiling up of the Blood, the Artery beats more ſtrongly and quicker, ſo long as the Spirits are in ſtrength; then they being a little exhauſted, the more ſtrong Pulſe is remitted; which however is compenſated with ſwiftneſs, and is made quick, and ſmall. If the Feaver be gentler, and is troubled with a leſſer burning, the Pulſe alſo declines leſs, from its Natural condition, and the moderation of this, in the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, denotes the truces of Nature. Neither doth the Pulſe only, betray the forces of the Feaver, as of an Enemy, but ſhews alſo plainly the ſtrength of Nature, and her ability of reſiſting. So long as the Pulſe is laudable, the matter goes well, and it ſhews good hopes; but from the evil ſtate of this, a bad omen is ſhewn, and a deſpair of Health. So without a frequent, and diligent examination of the Pulſe a Phyſician connot make a right judgment or Prognoſtication, or ſafely preſcribe Phyſick.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt thing, it ought to be known (as much as may be) what every ones Pulſe is, according to its Natural Conſtitution; for it is in theſe ſtronger, in thoſe weaker: then it is to be conſidered, in every moment of the Feavers, by what degrees it is diſtant from its Natural ſtate: for now it is ſomtimes more vehement, and argues the Feaver to grow ſtronger; now it is depreſſed, below its wont, and denotes the Spirits and Strength dejected.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe whoſe Pulſe in Health beats weakly and languiſhing, when taken with a Feaver, if they have a ſmall and weak Pulſe, it is not ſo evil a ſign, that we ſhould preſently deſpair of their Health: In whom the Pulſe is by Nature ſtrong and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if after the Criſis of the Diſeaſe, it hath ſcarce a moderate vigour, tho it be not wholly weak, it argues the condition of the ſick to be ſuſpected, and not ſafe.</p>
                     <p>If from the begining of the Feaver, before the Blood has flamed out, or if a Criſis being made, when part of the burthen is drawn away, or at another time, without an evident cauſe, the Pulſe becomes weak, it portends evilly: but if after long watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, or great evacuations, the Pulſe is made a little weaker, Health is not therefore to bedeſpaired of, becauſe the ſtrength caſt down by theſe means, or overwhelmed, may be reſtored, and the Spirits renewed.</p>
                     <p>When the Pulſe is ſuddenly altered for the worſe tho the ſick ſeem to be better, as to the reſt of the ſymptoms, you may foreſpeak the ſaid prognoſtication of Death; and ſo contrariwiſe, altho moſt horrid ſymptoms urge, and yet the Pulſe is laudable, Health may be yet hoped for. If in a ſtrong man, that hath a Feaver, the Pulſe is very ſmall, and creepingly, or becomes like the motion of Ants, death is at hand.</p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:107016:60"/>
                     <p n="2">2. In the exhibiting of Medicines, cautions and rules of no ſmall moment are taken; Purging and Vomiting are forbid, by the pulſe being too quick and violent; alſo by being low and depreſſed; becauſe, whilſt the Blood is too fervent, evacuation helps little, becauſe both what is hurtful is not ſeparated, alſo for that by the pertur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the ſtrength or ſpirits, are more debilitated. But when the ſpirits are broken, and ſtrength caſt down, Medicines caſt them more down, and ſomtimes wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws them. Wherefore, when a Phyſitian thinks of evacuation, upwards or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, he firſt examines the pulſe, and goes about this work only, when Nature is ſtrong and quiet; that ſhe may at once be at leiſure, for the operation of the Medicine, and may have ſufficient ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>Nor is there leſs need of circumſpection, in ſweating Medicines and Cordials: which, if adminiſtred in the Feaveriſh fit, do too much ſtrengthen, the former violent motion of the Heart, and oftentimes break its ſtrength; alſo, when the Pulſe is very languid, if hot and ſtrong Cordials are adminiſtred, (as when a ſmall flame is troubled with a more ſtrong blaſt of wind) life is eaſily extinguiſhed; wherefore, tis a vulgar obſervation, that Cordials often accelerate death, for that by too much troubling the Blood, they ſooner beat down ſtrength.</p>
                     <p>There is yet the moſt need of the caution, and direction of the Pulſe, in exhibitiug narcoticks; for theſe, (becauſe they perform their work by extinguiſhing, and fixing the too fierce vitalſpirits) if uſed in a weak or inconſtant Pulſe, either by diminiſhing the vital ſpirits, render them wholly inſufficient for the Diſeaſe, or by ſuffocating them too much, cauſe a perpetual ſleep: wherefore, in a languid, unequal, or formicating or creeping Pulſe, opiats are to be ſhun'd, more than a mad Dog or a Snake.</p>
                     <p>An unequal, and intermitting Pulſe, has a moſt evilreport, from the writings of Phyſitians; yet, altho of an ill note, does not ſo certainly portend death, as a weak Pulſe: for I have known many, to have recovered, tho by thoſe kind of ſigns con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the Grave; becauſe the inordination of the Spirits, and the Blood, may be more certainly and eaſily compoſed, or allayed, than their dejection reſtored.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The inſpection of Urines in Feavers, before all other Diſeaſes whatſoever, hath more of certainty, and is of greateſt uſe: for from hence, the conditions of the ſick, and of the Diſeaſe are beſt known, and the medical intentions, concerning what is to be done, are better directed; what obſervations, and rules, concerning this thing, are vulgarly ſet forth, are ſo many, that it would be almoſt an infinite labour and tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to recount them all: it will be ſufficient here, to note the chief of them.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Urines of perſons in Feavers, there are chiefly to be conſidered, the colour, conſiſtency, contents, and ſubſidency or ſetling. The colour of the Urine, ſhews the meaſure, or exceſs of heat in the Blood; which, as it is increaſed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more remiſs; the Urine alſo is more, or leſs red; the cauſe of which is, the ebullition of the Blood or the efferveſcency induced from the Feaver, to the Blood; by reaſon of which, the particles of Salt, and Sulphur, implanted in the Blood, humors, and ſolid parts, are more diſſolved, and incocted with the <hi>ſerum,</hi> and impart to it a red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; even as, when Salt of Tartar, and common Sulphur being mixed one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and boiled in water, impart a deep red colour to the Liquor.</p>
                     <p>The Urines of ſome, are highly red, when they are but a little, or lightly Feaveriſh: and on the contrary, the Urines of others, labouring with a Feaveriſh burning, are leſs coloured. Who abound with lively heat, and a very hot Blood, or are obnoxious to the Scurvy, phthiſis, or hypochondriac diſtemper, when by taking cold, condenſation, ſurfeit, or drinking of Wine, they are troubled by any little Feaver, they render a Urine ſtrongly red: for that the particles of Salt and Sulphur, remain exalted in their Blood, and before half looſned; wherefore, there is a neceſſity, that the Feaver urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they are more boiled in the <hi>ſerum;</hi> on the contrary, they who are indued with a cold temper, with a faint and weak Pulſe, being taken with a Feaver, with a greater efferveſcency of the Blood, render their Urine leſs coloured.</p>
                     <p>The conſiſtency, contents, and ſubſidency of Urines, being put as it were upon the ſame thrid, depend all of them, on the aduſt and recrementitious matter, which is remaining in the Blood, after the Feaveriſh deflagration: if there ſhall be plenty of this, the conſiſtency of the Urine becomes ſomwhat thicker, and after it has ſtood, it is troubled by the cold: but if there be a leſſer quantity of this, or otherways derived than to the Reins, (to wit, by ſweat, or is called away by a critical tranſlation, to this or that part) the conſiſtency is made thinner, and the Liquor remains clear. Alſo the particles of this matter, do inlarge the contents of the Urine, which ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:107016:60"/>diverſly, according as the nutricious Juice, is now ſomwhat cooked, and aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated by the Blood, now altogether perverted, and carried into a putrifaction, ſome ſigns of concoction, and aſſimulation, ſhew themſelves, in the Urines of Feaveriſh perſons, now a laudable Hypoſtaſis, now ſome marks and rudiments of the ſame: A want of Hypoſtaſis, and the confuſion, and perturbation of the Urine, denote the concoction vitiated, But as this matter is more or leſs roaſted, in the Blood, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents are now of a pale, now of a red colour, like oker. By reaſon, that the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, confounded with the Blood, either the Spirit being ſtrong, begin to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and ſeparated, or the ſame being depreſſed too much, they are leſs able to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated, alſo the contents of the Urine, are wont to be more or leſs, ſooner or ſlower ſeparated, from the reſt of the Liquor, and to ſink down towards the bottom.</p>
                     <p>As to the Prognoſticks, to be taken from the Urine, we may take notice, that the colour of the Urine being ſomwhat more remiſs, the conſiſtency mean, the contents few, and the ſubſiding free or eaſily collected into a Cloud, portend good: on the contrary, a deep red, a thick and troubled confiſtency, thick and cloudy contents, which ſlowly or ſcarce at all ſink to the bottom, denote a very great heat, plenty of aduſt matter, and its being brought under, and ſecretion, difficult or fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>As to the Medicinal directions, the buſineſs depends on this, that we attend, by the frequent inſpection of the Urine, the motion of Nature, and be helpful to the ſame; neither is it to be moved, by purge or ſweat, but when a certain hypoſtaſis of the Urine ſhews ſigns of concoction and ſeparation. I thought it needleſs to ſay any more here concerning this matter, becauſe thoſe things are more largly handled elſewhere, in a proper place, which belong to Urines.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XI.</hi> Of the Kinds, and Cure of a Putrid Synochus, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Feaver.</head>
                     <p>ANd thus much for a Putrid Synochus in general, in which is deſcribed its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon, according to the accidents and ſymptoms which are commonly obſerved in its Figure; there are beſides, (I ſhall not ſay ſpecies but) ſome varieties, or irregularities of this Diſeaſe, in which, this Feaver ſomtimes declines from this common Rule, and by reaſon of ſome accidental Diſtempers, gets new names and diſtinctions.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place therefore, a Putrid Synochus is wont to be divided into Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick, and eſſential; It is called Symptomatick, which draws its beginning from ſome other Diſtemper, or Diſeaſe before excited in the Body, ſo that the Feaver, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſymptom, coming upon that other Diſeaſe: of which ſort is accounted, what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the ſquinancy, pluriſie, the inflamation or impoſthume of the Lungs, or any impoſthume from a wound, or ulcer in a principle part, or its neighbourhood, of which we think a little otherways, <hi>viz.</hi> That truly no Putrid Feaver is merely Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical; perhaps it may ariſe occaſionally, from ſome other Diſtemper; but it is founded immediatly, in the Sulphureous part of the Blood being made too hot, and as it were inkindled: for without a Procatarſis, or preceeding indiſpoſition of the Blood, the aforeſaid Diſtempers, rarely, or not at all, cauſe a Putrid Feaver.</p>
                     <p>As to what reſpects the ſquinancy, pluriſie, the inflamation or impoſthume of the Lungs, and the like; I ſay, that theſe are the products of the Feaver, or Diſtempers following it; but by no means the cauſe of it; for moſt often the evident cauſe, went before, which produced the Feaveriſh efferveſcency of the Blood, as a taking of cold evacuation being hindered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then, altho the ſick do not openly grow preſently into a Feaver, yet a greater ebullition of the Blood, than was wont, is ſtirred up, as may be eaſily conjectured from the Urine, Pulſe, and inquietude of the whole Body. After ſome days, (nhw ſooner, now later) an Inflamation is brought forth, in one part or other; the reaſon of which, may probable enough be ſaid to be of this ſort: The
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:107016:61"/> Blood, by reaſon of the <hi>effluvia</hi> being retained, (which are like ferment) is increaſed in its bulk, and grows more turgid than its wont, in the Veſſels; and when for want of Ventilation, it is ſtreightned in the ſpace of its circulation, it eaſily ſprings forth, where it can find a paſſage, through the Arteries, and being extravaſated, from the broken thred of Circulation, it gathers together into a Tumor: and becauſe from this kind of tumor, an heat, and pain, are increaſed in the part, the Blood is more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed in its motion, and ſo the Feaver, at firſt inkindled, is more aggravated.</p>
                     <p>Further, in theſe kind of Diſtempers, we may take notice, of a certain aptitude of the Blood to be coagulated, whereby it is made leſs fluid, ſo that it is apt to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed in the leſſer Veſſels: even as it is to be perceived in Milk, when it begins to ſour, for then it will not be boiled, nor heated over the fire, without coagulation: and in like manner, there is to be ſuſpected in the Blood, a certain diſpoſition to growing ſour, by reaſon of which, it is made more obnoxious to coagulation; for it eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in a pluriſie, a peripneumonia, the ſquinancy, and the like Diſeaſes, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamation, or extravaſation of the Blood, does not always depend on the exuberancy of the Blood, and plenitude of the Veſſels: for oftentimes, the Blood is ſtopped in its motion, with a weak pulſe, and a ſinking down of the Veſſels, and beign extravaſated in the ſide, or elſewhere, cauſes a moſt acute pain, yea being driven from one part, by and by its fixed in another: and ſomtimes it begins to ſtagnate in the heart it ſelf, and there oftentimes induces a deadly oppreſſion: wherefore, ſome pluritical people, are wont, when the pains are gone, to complain of a great burthen, and as it were weight, fixed about the region of the Heart: And when we have opened the dead Bodies, of ſuch as have dyed of theſe kind of Diſeaſes, we have ſeen the Blood to be gathered together, in little bits, or oblong gobblets, in the ſecret parts of the Heart, and round about the cavities of the Veſſels. But for that theſe Diſeaſes, are wont to be handled apart from the Feaver, therefore we ſhall ſay no more of them here.</p>
                     <p>It only remains, that we inquire, whether the Feaver which acompanies theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, is to be eſteemed in the rank of thoſe, that are called Putrid, or not? To which we reply, that moſt often, they are ſimple Feavers, in which only a ſubtil, and ſpirituous part of the Blood is inflamed; and therefore, if the extravaſated Blood may be reſtored to circulation, by a plentiful detraction of the Blood, or an emptying the Veſſels by ſweat, preſently the growing hot of the Blood is appeaſed, and the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhortly allayed. But ſomtimes, when a prediſpoſition, as in a Plethora, or fulneſs of good humor, or in a great Cacochymie or fulneſs of evil Juices, brings it on, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſame kind of diſtempers, a Putrid Feaver is inkindled, wholly from the ſame cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Among the ſymptomatick Feavers, is reckoned that which is commonly called the ſlow Feaver: they who are ſick of this, are more than uſually hot, eſpecially after eating, any motion, or exerciſe; the Urine for the moſt part is red, the Spirits are feeble; and ſtrength caſt down, as to their appetite, and reſt, they are indifferently well, they have neither Cough, nor much ſpitting, but they daily (like thoſe in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions) grow lean, without any evident cauſe. The fault for the moſt part is aſcribed, to obſtructions in ſome inward, (as the liver, ſpleen, or meſentery) by whoſe default, the aliment is not well Cooked, nor rightly diſpenſed. But it ſeems to me, that this ſort of diſtemper, is immediatly founded in the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, by which it is inclined, into a too ſalt and ſour temper, and therefore is rendred leſs apt for nutrition, and an equal circulation. For the Blood in the Heart, juſt like oil in a Lamp, if it redounds too much with ſaline Particles, is inkindled not pleaſantly, and equally, but with a noiſe, and great evaporation of the parts; whereby indeed, it is ſooner waſted, and exhibits but a languiſhing, and weak flame. I opened one, ſomtime ſince dead of this Diſeaſe, in whom the Viſcera deſtinated to concoction, were well enough, but the Lungs were without moiſture, and dry, and beſet through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out with a ſandy matter like Chaulk. Alſo oftentimes, in this Diſeaſe, the Meſentery is beſet, the glandules being filled with ſuch a Chaulky matter: But whether the Blood being made more ſaltiſh, doth firſt bring in theſe kind of diſtempers of the Viſcera, or whether the Dyſcraſie, or evil diſpoſition of the Viſcera, firſt brings it upon the Blood is uncertain: it ſeems probable, that either diſtemper depends upon the other, and that the cauſes of either evil are reciprocal.</p>
                     <p>But the Feaver, which chiefly deſerves to be called <hi>Symtomatic,</hi> is that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in Phthiſical perſons, from an Ulcer, or Conſumption of the Lungs. For the whole Blood, whilſt it paſſes thorow the Lungs, in its circulation, often impreſſes on this
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:107016:61"/>Inward, the ideas of very many Diſeaſes; and on the other ſide, receives the ſame from it, being evilly affected, whatſoever impure thing is conteined in the maſs of the Blood, as the flowring of New Wine, is caſt forth by extremities of the Arteries; wherefore, when Nature being made more weak, it cannot transfer its recrements into the ſuperficies of the Body, it depoſes them, by a more near Purgation into the Lungs. From hence a Cacochymia, or fulneſs of ill juices, and many Chronical Diſeaſes, end in a Conſumption: in like manner, when the fleſh of the Lungs waſts, or abounding with an Ulcerous matter, becomes half putrid, the Blood paſſing through it, is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with the purulent matter, or tabid infection, and for that cauſe, is ſtirred up into a continual Efferveſcency, by reaſon of the confuſion of ſomthing not miſcible, and wherefore, it induces an aſſiduous Feaver, and wholly perverts the Alible Juice. The ſame reaſon is, of Feavers, form an Ulcer, or Impoſthume, oftentimes raiſed up in other parts: for theſe, even as the tabid conſtitution of the Lungs, cauſe oftentimes a Conſumption, and Hectick Feaver. The full conſideration of theſe, are not for this place, wherefore, we will return, whence we have digreſſed, to a Putrid Fever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called, or eſſential.</p>
                     <p>The Eſſential Putrid Synochus, is wont to be divided, into a Putrid (ſuch as is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready deſcribed) into a Cauſon, or hot burning Feaver; and beſides into a Quotidian, Tertian, and Quartan: The Putrid Synochus, but now delineated, ought to be the rule or ſquare of the reſt, to whoſe type, moſt Feavers, which are of this kind, are to be compoſed. As to the reſt, but now mentioned, according as they vary their kind, I ſhall briefly ſubjoyn.</p>
                     <p>The Cauſon, or Burning Feaver, is that which performs its courſe, with a greater heat, almoſt intolerable thirſt, and other ſymptoms, arguing a greater inflamation of the Blood: The formal reaſon of it, by which it is differenced from the reſt, conſiſts in this; that the temper of the Blood is hotter, that is, abounds more with fireable Sulphur; therefore, when it grows fervent, it is inkindled in a greater plenty, and with its deflagration, diffuſes the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of a moſt intenſe heat, through the whole Body: its motion is acute, and quickly comes to its ſtanding, it is compaſſed about with more horrid ſymptoms, hath a difficult Criſis, and an even full of danger.</p>
                     <p>But as to what reſpects thoſe periods, or fits, in which a Putrid Feaver ſomtimes is wont to be more cruel, at a ſet time; and (as if intermitting) now every day, now every third, or fourth day, repeats as it were the Feaveriſh fit; the reaſon of this ſeems not eaſily to be explicated: eſpecially, if we reject from this cenſe, the fewer humors, to the ſpontaneous motion of which, this diſtemper is commonly aſcribed, concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what ſeems moſt likely to me, I ſhall doubtingly propoſe. In a continual Feaver, there are two chief things, (as we have already noted) which for the moſt part, induce the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fervency of the Blood; to wit, the exaltation and inkindling of the Sulphureous part of the Blood, then conſequently, an heaping together of the aduſt matter, and remaining after the burning of the Blood, to a ſwelling up: upon the former the continuance of the feaver, upon the other, its ſtanding, and critical perturbations, depend: to theſe ſome times, a certain third thing happens, to wit, a fulneſs, and ſwelling up of the crude Juice, from the Aliments newly taken; which in a continual Feaver, (as in the fits of Intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feavers) induces a greater Effeervency, at ſet intervals of times. But why this does not always happen, nor wholly after the ſame manner, the reaſon is this: when the Putrid Synochus is very acute, and the whole Blood almoſt is quickly inflamed, and highly rages, whatſoever of Nutritious Juice, is poured to the Blood, is preſently burnt, and conſumed by the fire; wherefore, little or nothing of it, is conteined in the maſs of Blood, of rthe matter of a fit. But if this Feaver be leſs acute, and the Blood only flames forth moderately, and in parts, the ſupplement of the crude Juice, is not wholly conſumed, by the burning; but is perverted, by a more gentle fire, into a Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative matter, which, when it ariſes in the Veſſels to a fulneſs of ſwelling up, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives a Flux, and by its Effervency, makes ſtronger the Feaveriſh heat, before glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Blood, as it were by the coming of new fewel. The flowring of this matter doth not ſeldom begin with a light ſhivering, or cold, and ſomtimes end with ſweat: but for the moſt part, it is exhaled by inſenſible tranſpiration. In every fit, beſides the proviſion of the degenerate Nutritious Juice, ſomthing fro the aduſt, and burnt matter of the Blood, evaporates; wherefore, the Criſis of the Diſeaſe, is drawn forth longer, that tis hardly cured, under eleven or fourteen days; yea (for the moſt part) in this ſort of Feaver, with fits and remiſſions coming between, the perfect Cure of the Diſeaſe happens, ſcarcely within twenty days: and ſomtimes leiſurely, without
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:107016:62"/>any through Criſis, it remits, and then, by a long declination, it is ended in Death, or Health.</p>
                     <p>But that this kind of remiſſion, and acerbation or growing more violent, are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, according to the type of an Intermitting Feaver, that they repeat their turns now every day, now every other day, and ſomtimes not but within four days, the reaſon of this is to be ſought, from the Doctrine before delivered, of Intermitting Feavers: to wit, that according as the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, diverſly appears, the ſuppliment of the degenerate Nutritious Juice, ariſes to the fulneſs of ſwelling up, either ſooner or later; and for that reaſon, its Effervency, cauſes now more frequent, now more rare fits in this Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Cure of Putrid Feavers, of every kind, there are four general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, on which, the whole ſtreſs of the matter depends. Firſt, that the Blood, (if it may be done) may be defended from burning, and the flame, or fire inkindled in its Sulphureous part, the wholly ſuppreſſed; which about the firſt beginning of this Diſeaſe, happens to be often brought about. Secondly, that when the Blood having taken fire, cannot be preſently extinguiſhed, that at leaſt it may perform its burning more mildly, and with leſſer hurt. Thirdly, the deflagration being ended, that the Liquor of the Blood, be freed from the recrements of the aduſt and burnt matter, and afterwards reſtored, to its Natural temper and vigor. Fourthly, that the ſymptoms chiefly troubling may be timely helped, the which, unleſs taken away, will fruſtrate the work both of Nature and Medicine.</p>
                     <p>As to particular Remedies, with which theſe intentions may be ſerved, there are various preſcriptions, and forms of Medicines, not only among Phyſicians, but alſo among old women and Emperics, ordinarily in uſe: from which however, like a Sword in a blind mans hand, uſed without difference, and exact method of healing, more hurt than good, moſt often accrues to the ſick. There will be no need here to repeat the forms of Purges, Cordials, and of other Medicines, eligantly enough de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered among many Authors: I will add in few words, ſome chief indications, and Medical Cautions, which ought to be obſerved in the courſe of this Feaver, according to its various times, and divers ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. At the firſt beginning of this Diſeaſe, the buſineſs will be, that the Feaver may be preſently ſuppreſſed; and the inflamation of the heated Sulphur, may be inhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: to which, the opening of a Vein doth chiefly conduce; for by this means, the Blood is eventilated, and the heated Particles, too much heaped together, and almoſt ready to be fired, are diſſipated one from another: as when Hey, apt to burn, if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the open Air, its firing is prevented. Beſides, let a ſlender diet be inſtituted, in which nothing Spirituous or Sulphureous ought to be adminiſtred; The Viſcera, and firſt paſſages ſhould be freed from the load of excrementitious matter; wherefore, Clyſters are of neceſſary uſe; ſomtimes alſo Vomits, and gentle Purges; by which, ſomtimes timely and with judgment adminiſtred, the Feaver preſently after the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, is extinguiſhed, the Food of the fire being drawn away. If that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this method the burning ſpreads more abroad, and more and more, dayly ſnatches hold of the Sulphureous Particles of the Blood; it muſt be indeavoured, (as much as may be) that the deflagration proceed gently, without great tumult.</p>
                     <p n="2">2, When the Feaver is augmented, if the Blood be too hot, and diſtends the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels very much, with a vehement and ſtrong Pulſe; if watchings, a Phrenſie, or a pain of the Head cruelly urge, the letting of Blood may be again repeated; Tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as much as may be) ſhould be freely procured, wherefore, let the ſick keep in bed, for the moſt part; let the diet be ſparing, of the moſt ſlender Aliments, alſo drink ſmall, and plentiful, that the burning Blood, may be diluted with a more plentiful <hi>Serum:</hi> Clyſters are adminiſtred ſafe enough, and in truth commodiouſly; but Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, whether Cathartics, or Diaphoretics, and which too much exagitate the Blood, are to be ſhunned, with the ſame induſtry, as blaſts of wind to burning houſes: but rather Opiates, and Anodines which fix and bind up the Blood, and Spirits, are to be made uſe of; alſo Juleps, and Decoctions, which refrigerate the burning Viſcera, attemper the Blood, and cheriſh the Spirits, are often to be exhibited: acetous Liquors of Vegetables, or Minerals, alſo putrified Nitre, becauſe they reſtrain the rage of the Blood, and extinguiſh Thirſt, are truly convenient. Hot waters, and Spirits, Cordial, and Bezoartic powders, (ſo long as the Diſeaſe is not malignant) are not to be meddled with. If that the Blood be unequally circulated, and is carried more towards the Head, than the Feet, Epithemas are profitable, of the warm fleſh, or Inwards of Animals, applyed to the ſoles of the Feet.</p>
                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:107016:62"/>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Feaver is at its ſtanding, the motion of Nature is diligently to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, whether it will make a Criſis, or not; Wherefore, nothing raſhly is to be attempted by the Phyſician; the opening a Vein, or ſtrong Purgation, is wholly to be forbid; but after that the Feaveriſh burning is ſomwhat remitted, from the defla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of the Blood, and ſigns of concoction appear in the Urine, if that the motion of Nature be ſlow, a Sweat, or gentle Purge may be admitted; which however are bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſafer done, by the Phyſician, when Nature firſt, by a critical motion, hath entered upon the ſecluſion of the Morbific matter. If that all things are crude, and troubled, the Urine yet turbid, without ſediment, or ſeparation of parts, if the ſtrength be languiſhing, the Pulſe weak, if there be no Criſis going before, or only in vain, any evacuation, either by Sweat or Purge, is not to be attempted, without manifeſt danger of life: but it muſt be longer ſtaid for, that the Spirits of the Blood may recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may by ſome means overcome the excrementitious and aduſt matter, and then by degrees may ſeparate it, and put it forth; in the mean time, the Spirits are to be cheriſhed, with temperate Cordials, the immoderate Effervency of the Blood (if it ſtill be) is to be ſtopped, and its due Fermentation ſuſtained, which in truth is beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, by Corals, Pearls, and ſuch kind of powders; which indeed are diſſolved by the Ferments of the Viſcera, and then Ferment with the Blood, and greatly reſtore its weak and wavering motion. In the mean time, (whilſt Nature is labouring) all obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and impediments are to be removed, and eſpecially the proviſion of excrements, heaped up in the firſt paſſages, is to be brought away, by the frequent uſe of Clyſters.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 By what way or method, the ſymptoms chiefly urging, ought to be handled, will not be eaſily preſcribed by certain Rules; becauſe, they themſelves require ſomtimes to be preſently appeaſed, and quieted, and ſomtimes to be quickned forward: and what is ſomthing more, perhaps at another time, they are to be left wholly to Nature. Some of theſe are too oppoſed, with gentle and lenitive Remedies, but others with more ſharp and irritative Phyſic: yet in the mean time, it is a precept to be held in all, that you dilligently wait upon the footſteps of Nature: which if it works wrongfully, its diſorder is to be reduced; if rightly, yet too vehemently, to be bridled: If ſhe works rightly yet too ſlowly, or more weakly than ſhe ſhould, the buſineſs will be, that her endeavour may be incited, and helped, by the help of Medicine.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. In the declination of the Feaver, when after a perfect Criſis, Nature is ſtronger than the Diſeaſe, the buſineſs goes well, nor is there much buſineſs left for a Phyſician: It only remains, to propoſe an exact manner of diet, that the ſick may ſoon recover ſtrength, without fear of relapſing: alſo it is requiſite, to exterminate the Reliques of the Feaveriſh matter, with a light Purgation. About Diet, they often fall on the Rock of relapſing, <hi>viz.</hi> by the too haſty eating of fleſh meats, or more ſtrong Food, the ſick relapſe into the Feaver: for when the Viſcera are weak, and the Aliments (unleſs very ſlender) not eaſily digeſted, and when alſo the diſpoſition of the Blood, is weaker, that it does not aſſimilate the more ſtrong nouriſhing Juice; if any thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate is brought to either, the regiment of Nature is again perverted, and all goes ill. Wherefore, thoſe growing well, ſhould for a long time refrain from fleſh, and when at length they uſe it, it ſhould not be unleſs the Urine ſhall be like that of health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people, and no more troubled by the cold: and then indeed it will be ſafeſt, to begin with broths made of fleſh, and then by degrees, to proceed to more ſtrong Aliments.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. When from an imperfect Criſis, things are grown doubtful, and remain yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined; then is the Phyſicians moſt difficult task: The motions and ſtrength of Nature are carefully to be waited on, whether it begins to prevail on the Diſeaſe, or to yield to it: If ſigns of concoction appear, and that there is ſtrength, a gentle evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and only by leiſure, is to be celebrated. In the mean time, the ſymptoms moſt urging, are to be ſuccoured, with convenient Remedies, all impediments to be taken away, and ſtrength is to be ſuſtained (as much as may be) with Cordials, and a right manner of living or diet.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. When from an evil, or no Criſis, all things turn to the worſe, and when the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician almoſt diſpaires of Curing the Diſeaſe, he may predict its event ſuſpected, and much to be feared, But yet, he ought not to truſt to a naked Prognoſtication, to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all things elſe, but that as yet, what is in the Medical Art, ſhould be conſulted for Health, tho deſperate: Remedies may be adminiſtred, to the ſymptoms moſt infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting; the Spirits of the Blood almoſt extinct, may be reſtored by Cordials. When we deſpond of Health, life ſhould be prolonged as long as it may, and at leaſt a fair exit procured.</p>

                     <p>According to the various types but now deſcribed, of a Putrid Feaver, I might readily add very many Hiſtories of ſick people, and particular obſervations, made about their Cure; for theſe kind of examples are uſually met with in our dayly practice, ſo that they are ſufficient to fill a great Volumn; out of theſe however, with the good leave of the honeſt Reader, I will briefly propoſe ſome few, reſpecting the ſeveral kinds of the aforeſaid Feaver, by which their Doctrine, and Method of healing them, above delivered, may be illuſtrated.</p>
                     <p>A Noble Matron, about fifty years of Age, of a ſlender habit of Body, little ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, indued with a ruddy Complection, when on the fifteenth day of <hi>June,</hi> by reaſon of the Summers heat, ſhe had put on more thin Garments, than ſhe was wont, felt herſelf ill in the Evening; from thence ſhe was diſtempered with a nauſeouſneſs, and oppreſſion of her Stomach, ſhe felt wandring pains, troulbing her now in her ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, now in her back, very thirſty, yet without any immoderate heat: on the ſecond, and third day, almoſt after the ſame manner, on the fourth day after a Vomit, <hi>Viz.</hi> of the infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum</hi> one Ounce given, ſhe caſt forth yellow bile four times, and had three Stools, and ſeemed to be eaſed: the night following, ſhe ſlept ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better: but on the next day, the Feaver being throughly inkindled, ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of thirſt, a burning of the Praecordia, and of a pain, now in her ſide, now in her back; preſently blood was taken to eight Ounces, her Urine was of a very deep red, thick, and troubled without any Hypoſtaſis, or ſetling of the Contents, her Pulſe unequal, and often intermitting, the following night without ſleep: on the ſixth day of the Diſeaſe, early in the Morning, a ſmall Sweat broke forth, from whence the heat ſomthing abated, which in the Evening again grew ſtronger: on the ſeventh day, a very acute heat, with thirſt, burning, an inordinate and intermitting Pulſe, as alſo with a mighty reſtleſſneſs, and toſſing of the whole Body troubled her, on the eighth the ſymptoms were ſomwhat more remiſs, alſo in the Urine, ſome marks of an Hypoſtaſis; ſhe took that day poſſet-drink, with Meadow-ſweet boiled in it, and ſweated plentifully; and was cured of her Feaver. All the time of her ſickneſs, for Food they gave only ſmal Beer, Poſſet drink, Barly broth, or Grewel, alſo frequently Clyſters; Drink, and a cooling Julep, they gave her at her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>This Noble Lady, through tranſpiration being hindred, fell into a Putrid Synochus: the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> wont to be evaporated through the skin, being retained within, (together with the Choler flowing out of the Choleric Veſſels) and fixed to the Viſcera, did overthrow the diſpoſitions of their parts, and eſpecially gave trouble to the Stomach, and raiſed up pains and Convulſions, in the parts filled with Muſcles and Membranes: the Pulſe was unequal, and intermitting, not becauſe of the malignity of the Diſeaſe, as in the Plague, but by reaſon a certain proper diſpoſition of the Heart, by which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, its ferment being not well conſtituted, the Blood growing fervent is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently equally inkindled, and wholly leaps forth, but a part of the Blood, in flowing in a ſmall, then a greater, and after ſome turns the graateſt proportion, ſtoping for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of time, in the Boſoms of the Heart, produces the unequal and intermitting Pulſe. I have known in many others, clearly, the like diſtemper of the Pulſe: to wit, ſo long as they were free from intemperance, the Pulſe was altogether equal, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, but if they were more ſtrongly heated than uſually, by any ſudden paſſion of the mind, or too great agitation of the Body, preſently they were affected with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Pulſe, and between the vibrations or ſtrikings, intermitting perhaps 4, 7, 10, or 20. and as often as they fell into a Feaver, the Pulſe ſhewed it ſelf after this irregular manner. When this habitual irregularity, concerning the Pulſe, was not yet made known to me, by frequent experience, I was wont to ſuſpect ſtil a malignity in the Diſeaſe, and to foretel a fatal event, which hapned otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>On the fifth day, in this ſick perſon, the Feaver, although ſlowly inkindled, came to an augmentation, and from thence paſt through the reſt of the ſtations with a ſwift motion: on the ſixth a light emptying of the aduſt matter, ariſing to a fulneſs, a ſweat being riſen, and ſo a certain remiſſion of the Feaveriſh heat followed: on the ſeventh day, this aduſt matter ariſing to its height of increaſe, made the ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, to which, at length on the eighth day, a plentiful ſweat, with all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to a good Criſis, followed, and perfectly Cured the Feaver: becauſe (as it ought to be: thoſe three things went before this criticial evacuation, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt a full and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient deflagration of the Blood, as appeared by the very ſtrong heat, and plainly fiery, continued for three days before: alſo ſecondly, a congeſtion of the adult matter to a plenitude, as was collected by the high diſquiet, and toſſing about the preceeding
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:107016:64"/>and then a certain Pepaſmus or Concoction of the ſame matter, and a begun ſecreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Blood. which a ceaſing of the ſymptoms and ſigns of Concoction in the Urine, ſhewed: wherefore, the Copious ſweat, coming upon ſo laudable a ſign, ſo long as there was no ſuſpition of malignity, portended nothing but good.</p>
                     <p>About the beginning of the year 1656, a Gentleman endued with all active habit of Body, without any manifeſt cauſe, (unleſs that being much addicted to ſtudy, he uſed no exerciſe after it) became ill; at firſt he complained, of a nauſeouſneſs and want of Appetite, with a great Headach: on the ſecond day, he was affected, now with a ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, now with heat, ſeveral times reciprocating, beſides, with thirſt, and burning of the Praecordia, with a ſcurfieneſs of the Tongue, and an ingrateful ſavour. On that day, he took ten drams of an Emetick Liquor, by which he Vomited ſeven times, and caſt up a great quantity of yellow bile, and had four Stools; the night following he was unquiet, and almoſt wholly without ſleep, and in which the ſick perſon grew more Feaveriſh, with an increaſed heat: on the third day, when the aforeſaid ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were grown worſe, he was let Blood to ten Ounces: his Urine was red, thick, and with a copious ſediment; his Pulſe quick, and vehement; at night he ſweat a little, with a ſort ſleep, but diſturbed: on the following morning, he ſeemed to be a little eaſed: yet in the evening all things grew worſe, with moſt ſtrong wakings, heat, and thirſt: on the fifth day, by a lightſweat, the heat ſomwhat remitted, which yet a little before the evening, returned with its wonted fierceneſs, The night again was wholly without ſleep, with a continual toſſing up and down of his Body: In the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, by a little gentle ſweating, he felt a little eaſe; in the evening an encreaſe again of all things more cruelly; the night alſo was very unquiet: about the beginning of the next day, a ſweat, as before ſucceeded, and a little more plentifully: on this day was a manifeſt change towards health; the heat and thirſt was a little leſs vehement; his Urine was leſs red, with ſome Hypoſtaſis; thence, for three days, the Feaver leiſurly declined; yet every night he had a certain fit, but more remiſs than before on the eleventh day, he ſweated more plentifully, and was perfectly Cured: all the time of his ſickneſs, he uſed a moſt ſpare diet, taking truly nothing of Aliment, beſides ſmall Beer, and Poſſet drink made of it; he ſomtimes took drink, and cooling Juleps, of boiled Barly, and diſtilled waters; dayly, if his Belly was not looſe of it ſelf, an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Clyſter was adminiſtred: he uſed no other Phyſic beſides, to wit, neither Purge nor Cordial. But the Feaver being allayed, he was twice Purged, and from thence quickly grew well.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver was a Putrid Synochus, as may be conjectured by the ſhivering about the beginning, and then with continual heat, thirſt, watchings, and other ſymptoms grieviouſly infeſting, for many days: but foraſmuch, as its intemperature was exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated every night, it might be called a continued Quotidian: This Diſeaſe, made its firſt aſſault without any evident cauſe, becauſe the Blood being little ventilated, like Wine growing hot of it ſelf, had conceived an ardour, from the exalted Sulphur; the Choler flowing forth from the Choleduct Veſſels, and likewiſe the Purgings of the raging Blood, being poured about inwardly, (as it is wont to do for the moſt part in Feavers) preſently ſtirred up troubles, and diſorders in the firſt paſſages: therefore by reaſon of the excrementitious matter there heaped up, there was procured a depletion, and ſoon after the beginning, a Vomiting: notwithſtanding which evacuation, and likewiſe a more ſtrong Purging of the Belly by Stool, if adminiſtred, the Feaver be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly inkindled, becauſe they too much agitate the Blood, and diſturb greatly the Concoction of the aduſt Feaveriſh matter, for that reaſon bring more damage for the moſt part than benefit to the ſick: The firſt ſtation of this Diſeaſe, <hi>viz,</hi> until the whole Blood was fired, was extended to the third day; and then from thence, when the Blood flaming forth was burthened with aduſt recrements, its greater ebullition, with a frequent endeavour of expulſion by ſweat followed: on the ſeventh day, when the Blood for the greateſt part had flamed forth, and the aduſt recrements, heaped up in its boſom to a fulneſs of ſwelling up, began to be troubleſom, the critical motion was ſtirred up: by which nevertheleſs, that matter not being as yet wholly ſubdued, nor ready for ſeparation, the Diſeaſe was not perfectly Cured; but after another peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, the ſame increaſing, at laſt being ſtirred up, on the eleventh day, brought on that other, and perfectly Curing ſwelling up: in the days between, becauſe, beſides the recrements remaining after the deflagration of the Blood, and reſerved for a Criſis, alſo from the Nutritious Juice not preſently taking fire, but after a peculiar manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, other matter in the boſom of the Blood, apt to a ſwelling up, was gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; therefore, from the continual increaſe, and Flux of this, there hapned to this Feaver continual fits, (ſuch as are wont in Intermitting Feavers) on ſet days, and hours.</p>

                     <p>A ſtudious young man, about twenty five years of Age, of a dark Countenance, and Melancholic temper, without any manifeſt occaſion, began to be ſick, in the Year 1656. At firſt he complained of a Feaveriſh diſtemper with thirſt, a ſpontaneous weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and want of Appetite: moreover, on the ſecond day, of a pain in his right ſide, and a diſtention of either Hypochondrium, alſo, with almoſt continual Vomiting, waking, and very great pain of the Head; a Phyſician being ſent for, he was preſently let Blood to twelve Ounces. In the evening he grew more hot, and was light headed, afterwards, a ſweat, tho ſmall ſucceeding, he was better the next morning: on the fourth day again, he caſt up whatever he took preſently, alſo he was troubled with an almoſt continual endeavour of Vomiting. The exhibition of a Vomitory Medicine, propoſed by the Phyſician, both the ſick perſon, and alſo his Friends, taught by the danger of it before, rejected. From a Clyſter given him he had ſix Stools, and ſeemed to be a little alleviated; alſo the night following he ſlept ſomwhat: on the fifth day he again fell into frequent Vomiting, with intolerable thirſt: he burnt inwardly, but outwardly could not be felt any immoderate heat; becauſe the recrements of the effervent Blood, which ought to exhale through the skin, ſeemed to ſtagnate within, and to flow forth into the Viſcera. Therefore in the evening, this Bolus was given him, to provoke ſweat. Of Conſerves of Roſes Vitriolate one Dram, of <hi>Gaſcons</hi> powder one Scruple, of <hi>Laudanum</hi> ſoluted in Balm water one Grain: that night he ſlept mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately, and by a copious ſweat following, the ſymptoms ſeemed to be mitigated: Nevertheleſs on the ſixth day, all things again were imbittered, and a through heat, thirſt, and burning of the Praecordia, cruelly tormented him: on the ſeventh and eighth day the Pulſe was unequal, and diſordered, for the moſt part he talked idly, and if moved in his bed, fell often into a ſwound. On the ninth day, the ſame ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ſtopped, alſo he was troubled with a contraction of the tendons in his wriſts, and Convulſive motions of other parts, that we almoſt deſpaired of life. Becauſe that morning Nature ſeemed to be given over as conquered, ſhe was now to be ſuccoured, with what ever remained of Art. Wherefore, intending a more copious ſweat, as the laſt refuge, I gave him a Dram of Spirit of Harts-Horn, at one time, in a ſmall draught of Cordial Julep; upon which, being for four hours very unquiet and furious, he could ſcarce be held in his Bed; but afterwards ſleep creeping upon him, he ſweat very much, and the buſineſs ſuddenly came to be out of all danger. On the following night, for the continuing of the ſweat, I ordered to be given him, every ſix hours, a doſe of the powder of Contrayerva; the Feaver, and the Diſtempers of the Nerves, ſhortly ceaſed, and the ſick perſon became well.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver, as to the manner of its figure, may be called a Putrid Synochus; which, in this ſick perſon, from the Blood being made hot of its own accord, like Hay heating, and ſo conceiving an immoderate fermentation, took its original: by reaſon of the Melancholic temper of the Blood, the heat was leſs ſtrong, altho the ſymptoms were otherwiſe worſe, and hapned to be chiefly inimical to the Nervous ſtock: for the Blood burning forth, as fire in a Furnace, covered with chips, glowed with a moſt inteſtine burning: therefore, the ſick complained of the heat of the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, with an intolerable thirſt, when in the mean time, the exterior parts were but little heated: for this reaſon, and becauſe the Body was leſs perſpirable, the aduſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements of the Blood being about to make a Criſis, and which were wont to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed outwardly, at ſet times, being ſuffuſed inwardly, (Nature being very much op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and perpetually provoked) brought on cruel, and almoſt continual Vomitings; wherefore, when the Feaveriſh matter was derived to the firſt paſſages, by ſo frequent an endeavour of its expulſion, before the fulneſs, or concoction, no Criſis followed thereupon. Nor was the ſick man the better for that irregular evacuation, yea, the Blood being ſtill made worſe in its mixture, began to be corrupted in it ſelf, and wholly to pervert the Nervous Liquor; from whence, beſides the aſſiduous Vomitings, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Swoonings, inequal Pulſe, alſo Deliriums, and Convulſive motions did ariſe; but foraſmuch, as the mixtion of either humor, and diſpoſition, being not yet wholly looſned, or overturned, the Diaphoretic was adminiſtred, which by reaſon of its great agility, quickly paſt through both the Blood, and the Nervous Liquor, and a lively, and haſty Fermentation being raiſed up anew, carried forth of doors their impurities, and extraneous mixtures; the ſtate of the Diſeaſe tending towards Death, was reduced to Health, and by this means, inſtead of a Natural Criſis, by the help of a ſupplying Medicine, the ſick man, as it were recalled from the dead, quickly recovered Health.</p>
                     <p>A woman, being about thirty years old, of a ſtrong Body, and Melancholic temper, (as might be gathered by her very auſtere manners) in the third month after her lying in, got cold in giving her child ſuck, and uncovering herſelf, and upon it fell preſenly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:107016:65"/>into a ſhivering: To this, a heat more increaſed than uſual, followed, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, (a light ſweat ariſing) quickly remitted. On the ſecond and third day, ſhe was very thirſty, and without Appetite to Food, yet without immoderate heat, that ſhe could ſcarce believe herſelf in a Feaver: ſhe lay quiet every night, but wholly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep; her Urine was highly red, and with the multitude of Contents, thick, and cloudy, which however not troubled by the cold, remained ſtill after the ſame manner, without Hypoſtaſis, or ſinking down of the parts. On the fourth day, the heat was inkindled throughout the whole, wherefore, a Phyſician being then firſt ſent for, about twelve Ounces of Blood was taken from her Arm; after the letting of Blood, and her Belly the ſame day copiouſly emptied, by a Clyſter, in the evening ſhe fell into a ſweat, by which nevertheleſs ſhe was nothing eaſed, and (tho an Anodine Medicine was given her) ſhe wore out the whole night, (as before) without ſleep. On the fifth day, from a Clyſter being given, ſhe had three Stools, and felt ſome eaſe: her Urine ſtill remained red and troulbed: when Blood was preſcribed to be taken from her Ham, the ſick obſtinately refuſed, eſteeming herſelf to grow well; on the following night, when ſhe had lain long without ſleep, and unquiet, ſhe at length was troubled with a fit, ſuch as is commonly called Hyſterical, after a grievous manner; and at firſt, with a certain numneſs, or ſenſe of pricking, poſſeſſing the extream parts of her Body (eſpecially her Feet, Thighs, and Legs) ſhe was affected; and together with a wind, cruelly diſtending the Inteſtines, Ventricle, and Hypochondria: ſhe felt in the bottom of her Belly, as it were a certain bulk to creep upwards; which when it had aſcended to the Heart, and thence to the Brain, the ſick woman preſently was weakned in her Intellectuals, and all the night lay talking extravagantly and idly. On the ſixth day, after her Belly was taken down by a Clyſter, ſhe returned to her ſelf, and remained in her right mind, and ſeemed to be indifferently well. But in the Evening when ſhe was moved in her bed, ſhe began to feel the ſame kind of fit as before, to wit, ſhe had a ſenſe of pricking, as if ſtung with nettles, in all her body, together as it were a round thing rouling about in her belly, which creeping upwards, diſtended the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines and Ventricle, that ſhe emitted by means of it blaſts, and belchings: for eaſe ſake, ſhe required a draught of cold water. Moreover, the Remedies uſual in hyſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical diſtempers, as Caſtor, the ſmell of <hi>Aſafaetida,</hi> the fume of burnt feathers, liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and frictions of the Legs, and the like were adminiſtred, by the uſe of which, ſhe ſeemed for the preſent, free from the aforeſaid diſtemper, and was wholly without it for four hours: but when ſhe lay upon her back in her bed, as ſhe had ſetled her ſelf to ſleep, on a ſudden ſhe complained that the ſame Symptoms, did at once run through her whole Body, and by and by, ſhe fell upon it into a delirium; houling and crying out, ſhe talked idely the whole night; the day following, her eyes being open, ſhe lay without ſpeech or motion: again in the Evening, when her Feaver being increaſed, ſhe grew furious, that ſhe could ſcarce be held in her bed: and ſo ſhe remained for three days, now delirious crying out, and wailing, now as it were ſtupid without motion, or voice; yet ſtill ſhe was tormented with Convulſive motions, about the tendons of the muſcles: on the tenth day, ſhe drew her breath deep, and difficultly, with a weak, and as it were a creeping pulſe, and about the middle of the night died.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver was of the rank of the Putrid Feavers, which nevertheleſs, by reaſon of the melancholic diſpoſition of the Blood, (as we before intimated) was not very grievous, with heat or burning; but yet being very much infeſtous to the Brain, and nervous ſtock, was more difficult to be cured: The Blood being prediſpoſed to a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bot, eaſily contracted the diſtemper by taking cold, but yet, from the ſalt, and earthy ſeculencies, together with the Sulphur being moved, it was not openly inflamed; nevertheleſs, burning with an inteſtine, and as it were ſhut up fire, it was more notably depraved: Hence, preſently from the beginning, the Urine was highly red, and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, alſo ſhe continued wholly without ſleep: on the fifth day, the Blood burning forth, and being filled with the recrements, or aduſt matter, was irritated by its plenitude to an endeavor of excretion; wherefore, this night, a ſwelling up being ariſen, it tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred its load, not diſperſable by ſweat, into the head, and there affixed it to the Brain, and nervous ſtock: From thence, preſently, the wonted irradiation of the animal Spirits, being diſturbed in the fountain it ſelf, their inordinations firſt hapned to be felt, in the extream parts; wherefore, there was a pricking in the whole Body, the Belly inflated, the hypochondria diſtended, and as it were a certain ſubſtance or live thing, aſcending upwards, and ſucceſſively running through the Belly, precordia, and at length the head: For theſe kind of Symtpoms, ariſe not (as it is commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved) always from vapors, lifted up from the Womb, and ſtriving or thruſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but, not ſeldom, from the Brain, and the beginning of the nerves being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:107016:66"/>for, when the evil is there inflicted, that the animal Spirits nigh their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, are diſturbed in their motion, neither (as before) blow up, and diſtend the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Bodies, preſently the other Spirits, implanted in the extremities of the nerves, being deprived of their wonted influence, begin to tumultuate, and being moved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinatly, and towards their beginnings, cauſe Convulſions in thoſe parts in which they dwell. This irregular, and Convulſive motion, begun in the extremities, by the continued paſſage of the Spirits, and of the nervous parts, creeps by and by into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts, and then to others, ſtill to thoſe nearer to the Brain, till at length, (the whole ſeries of Spirits, like Souldiers being carried ſucceſſively backwards) the Convulſions are continued, into the fountain it ſelf of motion; So as in truth, by this means, the Convulſive motions, are ſomtimes begun, a moſt long way, from the cauſe, or place of the diſtemper, as by this only argument plainly appears: to wit, as often as the influx of the animal Spirits, is inhibited in the leg, or arms, by a ſtrict ligature, or by leaning hard on them, a fenſe of pricking, or a cramp, with a numneſs, is felt, firſt in the foot or hand, which afterwards ſucceſſively aſcends towards the affected part: wherefore, in this ſick woman, by reaſon of the Feaveriſh matter, (to wit, the aduſt recrements) fixed on the Brain, by a critical tranſlation from the boſom of the Blood; and there beſetting the beginnings of the nerves, thoſe Symptoms, imitating the hiſterical diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per were ſtirred up: by reaſon of the nerves, (which are diſperſed through the whole Body, by means of the ſpinal marrow) being diſtempered near their original, the fenſe of pricking begun in the extream parts, by and by is perceived in the whole. By reaſon of a like hurt, of the ſixth pare in the fountain, Convulſions and diſtentions ariſe, firſt in its little branches, moſt thickly ſet about the Abdomen: That aſcent, as it were of a certain ſubſtance, was only a tumefaction of the Viſcera, and muſcles, ſucceſſively inflated or blown up, by the Convulſion; from thence, the ſame diſtemper (by the mediation or coming between of the branch of the ſame ſixth pare) creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along more upward, and ſtill more near the Brain, the precordia, and then the head it ſelf, (as by a certain vapor raiſed up from beneath) ſeemed to be taken; on the next day, when this Feaveriſh matter, at firſt lightly fixed in the Brain, was at length again amended by the Blood, the aforeſaid Symptoms ceaſed for a time: Then ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (the Blood again flowing, and depoſing its recrements again in the Brain) the ſame kind of diſtemper as before, this ſick woman felt to come upon her; which however, with rubbings, the ſmell of ſtinking things, and other Remedies uſed in the hiſterical paſſion, was retarded for four hours, from its aſſault; to wit, foraſmuch as the animal Spirits, being tyred out by the external object, and irritated into a violent motion, were hindred, that they could not ſo ſuddenly conceive Convulſive motions: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, when that incitation of the Spirits, outwardly exhibited, did ceaſe, the morbific cauſe ſtill troubling, thoſe Spirits being grievouſly beſet, not ſucceſſively (as before) beginning at the extremities, but on a ſudden, all, both in the Brain, and the nervous appendix, were at once acted into Confuſion. The Criſis being after this manner attempted, <hi>viz.</hi> By the tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter to the Brain, the event of the Diſeaſe, both in this ſick woman, and alſo in others, whoſe ſickneſſes I have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerved, for the moſt part hath a mortal ſucceſs. For the Blood, unleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly depraved, and hindred, ſcarce ever endeavors to purifie it ſelf, by ſuch a Criſis: and as often as it endeavors an excretion by this means, it inflicts on the Brain, and nervous ſtock, an evil, not quickly, nor eaſily to be blotted out: alſo, the maſs it ſelf of the Blood, very rarely, by the motion of ſuch a flowring, is rendred free, from the impure mixture of the Feaveriſh matter.</p>
                     <p>A learned young man, of a lean habit, and pale countenance, in the coming in of the Spring, being conſcious of no error as to his dyet, began to complain of a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and impotency in walking, alſo of a drowſineſs, and ſleepineſs of his head: on the ſecond day alſo, he was tormented with thirſt, want of appetite, and an heat of his precordia: on the third day, the Phyſician being ſent for, he took a Vomit, by which, when he had Vomited three times, and caſt downwards five times, cholerick and hot matter, he became ſomwhat chearfuller, and the night following ſlept indifferently well: on the fourth day, he bled a ſmall quantity; then his thirſt, and heat very much increaſed: his Urine was red, with a copious ſediment, and a little hypoſtaſis. But becauſe, after the ſigns of concoction in the Urine, the endeavour of Nature, as it were oppreſſed, appeared for ſeparation, without ſufficient evacuation, therefore he was let Blood to ſeven ounces, and he ſeemed thereby to be very much eaſed, yet in the evening, all things grew worſe, and then for three days, the Feaver ſeemed ſtill to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed: on the ſeventh day, he complained of a great heavineſs in his head, and of a darkneſs, turning about in his eyes: after noon, an hemorrhage or bleeding copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:107016:66"/>followed, that for the great loſs of Blood; the ſick perſon had almoſt loſt all his ſtrength, and there was a very great neceſſity of medicinal help to ſtop the Blood: For this end, when a vein in his Arm was opened, Ligatures, and proper medicines were applyed, both to his head and belly, and very many other Remedies (the occaſion of haſty curing urging) preſcribed by every body, were tryed in vain; at length, by the perſuaſion of a woman, coming there by chance, a red hot Iron was held to his bleeding noſe, and on a ſudden, from the vapour of the burnt Blood, received into the noſtrils, its Flux was ſtayed; this Remedy, I afterwards knew uſed to many, with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good ſucceſs. This great hemorrhage cured the continual Feaver, to which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, an intermitting quotidian followed, which afterward was quickly cured, by the method of curing already delivered.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver, beginning without any manifeſt occaſion, and continued for many days with thirſt, and heat, may be called a Putrid Synochus; which yet without any horrid Symptom, about the beginning or ſtanding, was cured by an eaſie courſe, tho at length by a dangerous, and difficult Criſis: The turgeſcency of the Blood in the Spring time, and together the defect of ventilation in the ſame, gave the beginning to this: The Blood burning out, with a Feaveriſh fire, about the fourth day, had heaped up ſomthing of aduſt matter; that flowring it attempted a critical motion, tho with a ſmall hemorrhage: The defect of a more full evacuation, the opening of the vein ſupplyed for a time, afterwards, the aduſt recrements being heaped together, in great plenty, the ſame being not apt to be diſſipated by ſweat, in a body not rightly perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, at the time nature was about to endeavour a Criſis, a mighty bleeding followed. For when the Blood, by reaſon of the ſecluſion of the Feaveriſh matter, is agitated with a critical motion, very many of its particles are looſned from the mixture, ſo that a greater ſwelling up being provoked, they carry forth every extraneous thing confuſed with them: if at this time the breathing places of the skin, be but little open, the maſſe of the Blood (as new Wine ſtopped up in a bottle of a ſmall mouth) even more notably grows turgid, and becauſe it cannot ſhake off the Feaveriſh matter, by ſweat, it carries it ſelf forth of doors, together with it, any way it can find; wherefore, when there lies a moſt eaſie paſſage, for the boiling Blood, through the veſſels opening into apertures of the noſtrils, from that Port (like the ſame new Wine when the veſſel is opened) being inlarged by a ſpumous refraction, it abundantly leaps forth. The continual Feaver being cured, by this means, an intermitting Quoridian followed, becauſe after a long deflagration of the Blood, and great loſs of it, what Blood was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, being very much deprived of Spirit, and the Salt, with the left Sulphur being thorowly roaſted, eaſily contracted that kind of diſpoſition, whereby it was apt, not rightly to concoct the alible juice, but to pervert it into a matter very fermentative.</p>
                     <p>A Matron, about ſixty years of age, when ſhe had ſat up a certain night, going to bed in ſheets not throughly dry, began to be ill, at firſt ſhe was troubled with a ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Catarrh, that by reaſon of the ſerous deluge, falling on the ſarynx, ſhe could hardly breath; neither could ſhe ſleep; the next day with a nauſeouſneſs, and want of Appetite, with ſome little exceſs of thirſt and heat: on the third day, an acute pain invaded her in her ſide, with a Cough, and the Feaver increaſed: her Urine was red, and clear, with a laudable Hypoſtaſis, an unequal, and an intermitting pulſe. A Phyſician being ſent for, ſhe was let Blood to ten ounces, alſo that day, her belly was copiouſly looſned by a Clyſter: About night the pain vaniſhed, and ſhe ſlept indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently: her Urine was then red, troubled, and full of contents: on the fourth day, the Feaver was ſomwhat increaſed: In the evening troubled with a Cough very much, and by and by following thereupon the acute pain (as before) in the ſame ſide; her Urine being again clear, with an hypoſtaſis: Her pain, from her being let Blood again ceaſed; on the fifth day, the Feaver was more remiſs, but at night ſhe was unquiet with heat, and a toſſing up and down of her body, but without pain. The next morning ſhe ſweated plentifully, and was eaſed; then uſing ſtill a ſlender dyet for ſome days, and being once purged, ſhe grew well without relapſing. It is worth obſervation, that whilſt the pain troubled her, the Urine was clear, and with an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſis, nor troubled by the cold; which however, the ſame being allayed, became pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently thick, more red, and filled with contents.</p>
                     <p>This Diſeaſe, becauſe of the acute pain in the ſide, as it were a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>thognomic ſigne, might be called a Pluriſie: but we have here a Feaver, preceeding the pain, and not the product of it; The evident cauſe of the ſickneſs was Tranſpiration being hindred by the conſtriction of the pores; The Blood growing hot, by reaſon of the <hi>Effluvia</hi> being retained, and alſo too much abounding with a ſerous latex, as it were vomiting very much of it, from the Arteries terminating in the Larynx, cauſed the ſenſe of the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:107016:67"/>ſuffocating Catarrh: For this kind of diſtemper (as alſo the Cough with great ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) ariſes not, for that the watery humor (as is commonly ſaid) falls from the head, into the throat, and lungs; but becauſe the ſerous Latex is poured forth, now from the pneumonic veſſels, immediately into the lungs, now dropping forth from the Arteries opening into the larynx, falls down on the breaſt; on the third day, from the ſame ſerous humor, with a portion of the Blood, being fixed in the ſide, the acute pain aroſe; for the Blood beginning to grow fervent, when as yet it did contain in it ſelf a crude matter, and (as it ſhould ſeem) ſomthing ſour, from the degenerate alible juice, depoſed the ſame, (becauſe it could not caſt it forth of doors by ſweat) by a proper luſtration or purging through the intercoſtal Arteries, into the membrane ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ribs; and there (as it is always wont in a Pluriſie) either by coagulation, (which may be lawfully ſuſpected) or by the ſhutting up of the veſſels, the Blood being intangled with the ſame matter, is ſtopped in its motion; then being increaſed in its bulk, by a new coming ſtill of the Blood, it cauſes a break of the union, and ſo an acute pain. That in this ſick woman, the ſame kind of matter, diſturbing the maſs of Blood, with a portion of it extravaſated, was fixed about the Pleura, it from thence hapned, becauſe the pain urging, the urine was clear, and not full of contents: then, when the veſſels, by reaſon of Phlebotomie, being emptied, they ſupped up again that matter, into its maſs, before exterminated from the Blood, the urine preſently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came troubled, and again big with contents: The pulſe was unequal, and intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, becauſe of the idiocraſie or proper diſpoſition, which ſhe was wont to have in every intemperature: for when I. cured this woman of a Feaver, many years before, her pulſe being unequal, and intermitting, had ſtruck a fear in me, and others, of a ſad preſage, concerning the event of the diſeaſe, which however at that time, (as alſo in this ſickneſs) ceaſed, proſperouſly, without any horrid Symptom.</p>
                     <p>A ſtrong young man, and corpulent, after immoderate exerciſe, about the Summer ſolſtice, and then a ſudden cold coming upon the heat, found himſelf ill: At firſt, a want of Appetite, nauſeouſneſs, and cruel pain of the head, as alſo thirſt, and a more intenſe heat than uſual troubled him; on the ſecond day, an acute pain invaded him in his right ſide with a Cough, and difficult breathing; Blood being preſently taken plentifully from the Arm of the ſame ſide, that pain remitted ſomwhat, which yet in the evening returned, being made more cruel by a Cough, and bloody ſpittle. The night followed, without ſleep, and very unquiet: on the third day, he was again let blood, beſides Liniments, and fomentations were applyed to his ſide; Moreover pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Juleps, and antipleuretick decoctions, being taken inwardly, about night the pain almoſt wholly ceaſed. Then by and by, he was afflicted with a cruel headach, and a vertigo: on the fourth day, a ſtream of Blood fell from his right noſtril, about two ounces, by which the pain of his head clearly ceaſed, and the vertigo; but in the Evening, the pain in the ſide before diſtempered, returned with greater fierceneſs: In the mean time his Pulſe was ſmall, and weak, that when it was conſulted upon, for the letting him blood again, 'twas thought dangerous, leſt his dejected ſtrength would not admit of ſuch a remedy: wherefore, Phlebotomie was performed only, in a very ſmall quantity, and a fomentation, and a Cataplaſme was preſcribed to be diligently applyed to his ſide; beſides twenty drops of the ſpirit of Harts-horn, to be taken in a ſpoonful of Cordial Julep, and the ſame to be repeated continually, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of ſix hours: He ſweat that night very much, and the pain much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, his ſpitting was but little, interſperſed with Blood, which, within a day wholly ceaſed, and the pain alſo leiſurely vaniſhed. The ſick man took twice a day, a ſcruple of the ſame ſpirit of Harts-horn, and within a few days, he grew perfectly well, without relapſing.</p>
                     <p>This Feaver was a ſimple Synochus, ſtir'd up from the evident cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of the pores: as ſoon as the Blood began to be ſomwhat filled with aduſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements, and ſo to ſwell up more, the matter, which ſhould have been ſeparated, by reaſon of its peculiar evil, was transferred into the Pleura, and being there fixed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the Blood coming to it, to be coagulated, and therefore to be ſtopped in its circulation, and (when it could not be received by the veins) preſently to be extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated: from hence hapned the acute pain in the ſide, and bloody ſpittle, by and by, after the beginning of this Diſeaſe; then afterwards, the ſame matter being thruſt out of that neſt, which it had got, and being ſupped up again into the maſs of Blood, was fixed in the head; and there inducing the like ſtagnation of the Blood, and (as it is probable) coagulation, cauſed the vertigo, and cruel pain; which nevertheleſs was quickly cured, by the hemorrhage being ariſen, by reaſon of the extravaſated Blood. A part of the morbific matter, being after this manner drawn away, the other part
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:107016:67"/>reſumed by the Blood, was again conveyed to its uſual neſt, to wit, the ſide before diſtempered; where depoſiting its latex, (to wit, a portion of the Blood) it did coagulte it again, and compelled it to be extravaſated or to flow out of the veſſels: For that pain being renewed on the fourth day, with the bloody ſpittle, from the ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the Blood, too extreamly, and therefore flowing out of the veſſels, would not be brought away; becauſe at that time, the Pulſe was ſmall and weak, with a falling down of the veſſels, that indeed the Blood was thought to have been run all out of the veſſels, for that being coagulated by the morbific matter, (and therefore tho ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed the Arteries, yet not being able to be carried back by the veins) it was ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in its circulation. Upon this, an acute pain followed, becauſe the Blood being heaped together by its frequent approach, and elevated into a Tumor, made a diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the union; alſo, by and by from the beginning, a bloody ſpittle came upon it, becauſe the Blood being reſtrained within, in the Body, ſomwhere in its motion, by reaſon of the moſt tender, and eaſily opening little mouths of the veſſels, ran forth into the Cavities; when to the ſame outwardly extravaſated, by reaſon of a more thick skin, and the mouths of the little veſſels being locked up, no way lay open, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs by its being made and ripened into an Impoſthume. The opening of a vein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited in the beginning of the Pleuriſie, becauſe it reſtrained the Blood, ſomwhere hindred in its circuit, from too great effervency; but eſpecially, for that, when the veſſels were by that means greatly emptied, they did again receive, and render fluent, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever humors were before exterminated, and alſo the Blood beginning to ſtagnate in the diſtempered part. Alſo, the remedies helping moſt, about the beginning of this Diſeaſe, were of that ſort, which hinder the coagulation of the Blood, or diſſolve it in the coagulating; ſuch they are, which abound very much with a volatile, or an alcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſate Salt: to wit, ſpirit of Soot, of Blood, Harts-horn, alſo ſpirit and ſalt of Urine, the pouder of the claws and eyes of Crabs, of a Boars tooth, or the Jaw of a Pike, are of known uſe. Among the common people, it is a cuſtom to drink an infuſion of Horſe dung; which medicine indeed, I have known often to have brought help, in deplorable caſes. In the mean time, all acid things whatſoever, becauſe they more coagulate the Blood, and hinder expectoration, are highly hurtful in this Diſeaſe.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XII.</hi> Of a malignant or peſtilential Feaver in general.</head>
                     <p>BEſides the continual Feaver, which is already deſcribed, and which ariſes from ſome principle of the Blood being too much carried forth, there is another ſpecies of this, which is ſtirred up, by reaſon of the Blood being touched with ſome invenomed Infection, and therefore liable to enter into various coagulations, and corruptions: In which, not only the Spirit and the Sulphur, as in a Putrid Feaver, rage, and compel the Blood to grow immoderately hot, but beſides, the mixture of the Blood is preſently diſſolved, and its liquor goes into parts; and ſo moſt horrid Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms, with manifeſt danger of life, are induced in this ſort of diſtemper. Under this rank, we comprehend malignant, and peſtilential Feavers, the Plague, ſmall Pox, and Meaſles: of which we ſhall ſpeak preſently.</p>
                     <p>Peſtilential Diſeaſes, wander ſo in the dark, and have an unknown original, that their cauſes, and beings are ſeldom explicated, without having a recourſe to occult qualities. By the unanimous conſent of all, the ſtrength, and power of theſe are placed in an invenomed matter; becauſe we perceive, from a peſtilent diſtemper, ſtrength ſuddenly to be overthrown, and life quickly deſtroyed, no otherwiſe than from the drinking of Poyſon. And therefore, for the explicating the nature of the peſtilence, it will not be beſides the matter, firſt, to inquire concerning Poyſon in general, and by what means it diſtempers our Bodies, then to ſhew what ſort of Poyſon is ſprinkled in the Plague, and contagious Diſeaſes: which being performed, we will treat parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of the Diſeaſes but now recited.</p>
                     <p>Every thing deſerves the name of Poyſon, which ſtriking into our Body, after an occult manner vehemently hurts the temper, and actions of any part, or of the whole, profligates the Spirits, or perverts their motions, ſolves the mixtures of the Liquors,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:107016:68"/>and induces Coagulations and Corruptions, deſtroys the functions and ferments of the Viſcera, and ſo ſuddenly and hiddenly brings life into danger. of theſe, which after this manner lie in wait for us, there is a mighty plenty, and very rich proviſion in the nature of things: oftentimes they are inly begotten within our body; outwardly they are abundantly ſupplyed from every Coaſt, and out of every tract of Earth, water and air, theſe daily ariſe out of the diſtinct families of minerals, vegetables, and Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and ſo mingle themſelves with our food, yea with our medicine, that we may complain with Plinie, <hi>quod non ſit fateri, an rerum natura largius mala, an remedia genue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> That it was not known, whether Nature had begot greater Evils, or Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</p>
                     <p>As there is great varieties of Poyſons, ſo, as to their Subjects, and ways of hurting, there is no leſs diverſity of them: for the moſt Poyſons, in their whole ſubſtance are ſaid to be contrary to us, that whatſoever they come to, with a burning force, and like fierce fire, they reduce into aſhes, yet out of theſe, ſome being noted for a peculiar raiſing of hurt, do more endammage one part or ſubſtance than another. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, on which the taint of Poyſon, is next and more immediatly inflicted, are two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold; to wit, the animal Spirits, or the ſpirituous ſubtil Liquor flowing in the Brain, and nervous ſtock; and the Blood flowing in the Veſſels, and heart, when the object is carried only to one, or being improportionate, at one to either, that from thence, the diſpoſition of the Liquors, or of the containing parts, is overthrown, whereby the neceſſary functions, for the performing of life and ſenſe, are reſtrained, and this done latently, and as it were unforeſeen, theſe kind of diſtempers, we aſcribe to Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>The nervous bodies, with the animal Spirit, are not invaded wholly after the ſame manner, by every ſort of Poyſons; for they are tormented, now with a Stupor, now with Convulſions, and thoſe of divers kinds, and manners: The bile of a Tarantula cauſes dancing: A power ſent from the Torpedo, by the Angle, or lines of the Net, ſtupifies the hand of the Fiſher. The roots of the wild Parſnip, or the ſeeds of Loli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um or Darnel, being eaten, make men mad: Opium, Mandrakes, Henbane, and the like, cauſe deep, and ſomtimes deadly ſleep. Theſe and many others, chiefly impreſs their Poyſon, on the ſpirituous or animal faculty, without any great perturbation of the Blood, or hurt brought to the heart.</p>
                     <p>There are alſo ſome Poyſons, which moſt of all inſinuate their malignity, to the maſs of Blood; wherefore, from ſome Medicines, there have been produced, a yellow or black Jaundice, ſomtimes a Leproſie, or leprous diſtempers, and ſwellings of the whole body, vapours breaking forth from ſecret hollows of the Earth, alſo from Coals newly inkindled, often ſuffocating the vital Spirits, at once congeal the Blood, and ſtop it in its motion, whereby the flame of life in the heart, could not be continued. How much corruption of the maſs of Blood is imparted from the peſtilent Infection, is perſpicuous to every one, from the ſpots and Whelks, which are as it were the marks of the blaſted Blood.</p>
                     <p>If the hurt, being firſt inflicted to either, <hi>viz.</hi> The regiment of the Heart, or Brain, be more lightly made, it is for the moſt part cured, without any great offence to either; wherefore, Convulſive motions, Stupifaction, Lethargie, Melancholy, Paralytick di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, do not ſeldom begin with a laudable Pulſe, and without an immoderate effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency of the Blood; and then, if the diſtemper does not get ſtrength, leiſurely end, and ceaſe. There are other Poyſons, which often deprave the Blood, and by diſſolving its mixture, corrupt it, in the mean time the animal functions remain whole enough. But if the ferment of the Poyſon be ſtronger, and hath more deeply fixed its roots, preſently the Poyſon is diſperſed, from one Province to the other: for when the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous parts ſwell up, with a virulent juice, a portion of the Poyſon, is carried with the nervous Latex returning through the Lymphatick Veſſels, into the veins, eaſily into the boſom of the Blood, and infects its maſs, with the evil with which it was big: alſo, from the Blood being grievouſly impoyſoned, the juice, by which the nerves are wate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, quickly contract the infection; hence mad men are in a Feaver, and thoſe taken with a peſtilent Feaver, are moſt often tormented with a Delirium, or Phrenſie. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe things, we muſt conſider, what the alteration is, or the impreſſion of hurt, which is inflicted from the Poyſon, to the animal Spirit, with the brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous appendex; and what alſo, to the Blood, with the Heart and the annexed Veſſels: tho here, it is not in the power of humane skill or wit, plainly to ſhew, or as it were point out with the finger the manner of its being done; yet we may be able to attain to ſome little knowledge of this thing, by reaſoning, and by comparing it, with other diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the former, we ſhall obſerve, that the ſubtil Liquor, or animal Spirits,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:107016:68"/>wherewith the Nervous Bodies are blown up, and by whoſe expanſion, ſenſe and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perform their reciprocal actions, are eaſily perverted from their tenſity, and equal expanſion: for as the Nerves are of a ſoft texture, and the Spirits which abound in them of a very ſubtil ſubſtance, they cannot endure any ſtrong or vehement objects; wherefore when any violent or improportionate thing falls on them, they are often compelled from their expanſion, and excurſion into flight, and a running backward, and not ſeldom into irregularities of motions: wherefore ſudden paſſions of the mind diſtract them, and drive them into Spaſms, and Convulſions; when the Alible Juice, by which they are repaired, is ſupplyed too ſharp, ſour or auſtere, they ſuffer now Palſies, and now contractures: If that ſome object more incongruous, (ſuch as we have affirmed Poyſon to be) ſhould be offered, whoſe Particles are indued with ſuch fierceneſs, or are of ſuch a kind of configuration, that when they grow impetuouſly hot with the Nervous Liquor, they ſhake or loſe here and there its more ſubtil or ſpirituous part, or wholly drive it away, and fix the remaining Liquor either with a ſtyptic force, or by ebullition, force it into inordinate motions; hence of neceſſity, evil di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Brain, and Nervous parts ariſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſomtimes a Convulſion, Tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, Shivering, ſomtimes looſnings, or a ſtupefaction, and other ſymptoms of more grievous note. What things after this manner infect the Nervous Juice with Poyſon, are now more thick, and only when they are applyed in a very Corporeal ſubſtance, do inflict their hurt; now they are thin, and being reſolved, even into a vapour or breath, pour forth from a certain little prick, the ferment of Poyſon, through the whole Nervous ſtock. Somtimes the Poyſon of ſome hurtful thing, being eaten, firſt begins its Tragedy in the Ventricle; more often by a naked touch, leaves on the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Body, a virulent taint, which eaſily and quickly with its ferment, contaminates the Spirits, diſperſed through the whole. The Infection, wherever inflicted, either within or without, is more largely diſperſed from the extremities of the Nerves, by their eaſie paſſage, being from thence brought into conſent of the evil, by the very many little ſhoots of the ſame branch. Often a more light touch of an invenomed thing, by the finger, or extremity of any other member, preſently communicates to the Brain, the received infection, and from thence it is retorted into the whole Body, and the fartheſt members; the reaſon of this is, that both the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Nervous Juice, and of the ſame invenomed infection, are ſo light, and ready for motion, that they paſs through moſt ſwiftly, as the Rays of light through a Diaphanous medium, the whole maſs of one another.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As often as the Blood contracts hurt from ſome Poyſonous thing, the Poyſon is fixed within; either ſlow, and of leſſer activity, which does not preſently betray it ſelf, nor break forth into cruel ſymptoms, till of a long time after, it is ripened by a ſilent fermentation, and hath firſt infected the whole maſs of Blood, as may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſome Poyſons, which are ſaid to kill at a diſtance, and not till after ſome months, or years. Or the Poyſons inſpired into the Blood, are imbued with a much more acute ſting, that from their Contagion, the Infection contracted, preſently breaks forth into cruel ſymptoms, and thereupon follows now a Feaveriſh effervency with Vomiting, Thirſt, and burning of the Precordia, now a ſwelling up of the whole Body, a diſcoloration of the skin, oftentimes a breaking forth of whelks, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes, and frequently alſo a ſudden loſs of all ſtrength, ſo that ſudden death, without tumult, and almoſt inſenſibly ſteals upon one: where by the way it is to be noted, If the Spirits of the Blood, provoked by the enemy, are able to encounter him, and to ſtrive for the victory, this Feaveriſh ebullition of the Blood is ſtirred up from the conflict; but if the Particles of the Poyſon, being far ſtronger, ſuddenly profligate the Spirits of the Blood, and extinguiſh life, preſently the Bloody maſs is corrupted, neither can it be circulated in the Veſſels, nor rightly inkindled in the heart.</p>
                     <p>If it be yet demanded, what mutations, the Blood infected with Poyſon, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes, either in its ſubſtance, or conſiſtency, that, for that reaſon it is rendered unfit for the ſuſtaining of Life? I anſwer after this manner; ſome Poyſons fuſe the Blood, and too much precipitate its ſeroſity, ſuch are Medicines, which by a ſtrong killing Purging, or by a <hi>Profluvium</hi> of Urine, or a diſcoloration, or ſwelling up of the whole Body, or with an eruption of Puſtules, cauſe a very great ſecretion of the ſerous Latex; in the mean time a great ebullition of the maſs of Blood is induced, whereby the Vital Spirits are greatly deſtroyed, the Particles of Salt and Sulphur too much exalted, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, and are often ſo roaſted, that a Yellow or Black Jaundies is cauſed.</p>
                     <p>There are Poyſons of another kind, far more dangerous, which congeal the Blood, and by deſtroying its mixture, corrupt it, <hi>viz.</hi> the firſt induce a congelation to the Bloody maſs, and then a Putrefaction: for when the Spirits of the Blood, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:107016:69"/>by the contagion of the Poyſon, are diſſipated, the equal mixture of the Liquor is looſned; wherefore the more thick Particles mutually infold one another, and (like Milk when Rennet is put to it, or growing ſowr of it ſelf) are coagulated apart: hence the Blood curdles in the Veſſels, that it is leſs readily circulated in them: coagulated portions of this, being inwardly diluted, into the boſom of the Heart, are apt to ſtagnate there, and ſo to bring forth frequent ſyncopes, and ſwounings: being carried outwardly, and in the circulating, fixed in the skin, ſomtimes being more plentifully heaped together, they induce a ſuffuſion of blackneſs through the whole, ſomtimes being more ſparingly diſperſed, they cauſe only ſpots, or Purple marks, like black and blew ſtroaks, and other appearances of malignity. But the coagulation of the Blood, quickly diſpoſes it to putreſaction or corruption; as is ſeen in extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated Blood, which is wont to grow ſoon black and putrid. For the Spirit being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled, the Particles of Sulphur and Salt remaining in the Blood, begin to go apart one from another, and to break the bond of the mixture, from whence follows Putrefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                     <p>Theſe things being thus premiſed of Poyſon in general, the reaſon of the method requires that we enter upon the handling of Feavers, which draw their Original, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together from a malignant, and invenomed infection: and as under this title, the Peſt or Plague eaſily obtains the chief place, I will begin with its conſideration, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, I will ſpeak of malignant Feavers, Small-pox, and Meaſels, in order. But yet, before I ſhall propoſe its definition, I will briefly inquire, of the peſtiferous Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, what its diſpoſition and Nature may be; alſo, from whence it may be born, and laſtly, by what means it is propagated into others, by contagion.</p>
                     <p>For the expreſſing the Nature of the Plague, Authors are wont to chooſe ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venomed Bodies, and from their names to frame an Elogy of this moſt wicked Diſeaſe; wherefore in the definition of the peſt, are commonly recounted the Nepelline, Aco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nital, and Arſenical Poyſon: the Lethiferous force of which however, as it conſiſts in a very thick matter, and does not exert or put forth itſelf but by a Corporal contact, doth not truly imitate the eſſence of the Peſtilential Diſeaſe: for this is founded in a Spiritual and Vaporous infection, by which its <hi>Effluvia</hi> being every way diffuſed, ſo potently unfold themſelves, that out of the beſt ſeminary or ſeed plot, they quickly propagate a fruitful Crop of death and deſtruction, By reaſon of its notable activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this infection may deſerve to be called, as it were a certain quinteſſence of Poyſon; the very agil and ſubtil Particles of this, do penetrate all Bodies, and inſpire them with its ferment: for either being diſperſed through the Air, or hid in a certain tender or cheriſhing neſt, tho they ſtrike againſt the human Body but lightly, and as it were through a Caſement, they eaſily ſubdue it; for both the Animal Spirits, and thoſe of the blood, they quickly infect, and by that means, ſhortly pour forth the Venomous taint, into all the members.</p>
                     <p>When a Peſtilential Breath or Vapour, hath invaded any one, and that Poyſon hath firſt laid hold on the Animal Spirits, or thoſe of the Blood, or both of them at once, (as hath been already ſaid of Poyſons) the taint is quickly derived from the ſubtil and more thin ſubſtance of theſe, into a more thick matter: becauſe it quickly ferments the whole maſs of Blood, or of the Nervous Juice, and the excrementitious humors, every where abounding, and from thence is deduced into the ſolid parts, and fixes the evil in them. If this Diſeaſe, firſt poſſeſſes the Animal Spirits, preſently the hurt is communicated to the Brain, and the Nervous ſtock, and eſpecially to the Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, forthwith it impoyſons the humour growing in theſe; looſens its mixture, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts the regular motion, and renderr it wholly incongruous, and infeſtous to the more tender ſubſtance of the containing parts: by and by from thence, Cramps and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive motions, cruel Vomitings, pains of the Heart, alſo Phrenſies, deliriums, or pertinacious watchings, are ſtirred up, about the firſt aſſault of the Diſeaſe: when in the mean time, the infection not being yet diſperſed through the Blood, the ſick are not Feaveriſh, nor are troubled with inordinate Pulſe, or Syncope, or appearances of marks; which ſymptoms however ariſe afterwards, as ſoon as the Blood is infected. If when the Spirits of the Blood are firſt poſſeſſed, with the impoyſoned infection, either drawn in with the Air, or attracted through the pores, its ferment is preſently diſſipated through the whole maſs of the Blood, the infeſted portions immediately begin to be looſned from their equal mixture, to go into parts, and to be coagulated, and the ſame, being delated, into the boſom of the Heart, are wont there to ſtagnate, and ſo to induce a Syncopy, Swoonings, and often ſudden Death; alſo being carried outwardly, fixed about the skin, to cauſe Buboes, inflamed riſings, and other marks of Poyſon; in the mean time, the ſick appear well in mind, nor are they troubled with Delirium
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:107016:69"/>nor Convulſive motions. If that from a more ſtrong cauſe, the hurt is inflicted to both parts at once, the courſe of the Diſeaſe is performed with a more horrid proviſion of Symptoms, and eſpecially with a Syncopy, and Phrenſie at once infeſting.</p>
                     <p>As to what appertains to its riſe; when the Plague firſt ariſes in any Region or Country, there is attributed a twofold cauſe of it, <hi>viz.</hi> Primary or Metaphyſical, alſo Secondary or Natural, ſubordinate to that: The very Heathens did acknowledg this Diſeaſe, wherever it raged, ſent firſt of all from God, for the caſtigation of the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of men, and therefore for its extirpation, they equally made uſe of Prayers and Sacrifices as of Medicines. As to what belongs to the Natural cauſe, there are divers opinions. Some will, that the Peſtilence newly ariſen, be derived from the Heavens, and influences of the Stars only: on the contrary, others have affirmed it only to ariſe from the internal putrefaction of the humors of our Body: but theſe endeavour to deduce the cauſe of this ſickneſs too far off, and theſe more near than it ought. We will walk in the middle way, and what Reaſon perſuades, and what very many Authors aſſert, we will place the chief and firſt ſeminary or ſeed plot of this Poyſon, in the Air; becauſe, it ſeems conſonant to Reaſon, that from the ſame Fountain, from which the common food of life is had, the beginnings of death, no leſs diffuſive, are to be ſought. There is the ſame neceſſity for our breathing in the Air, as of Fiſhes living in the Water; wherefore, as to waters infected by Poyſon, the murrain of Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes dying in heaps is aſcribed; ſo men dying of an Epidemical ſlaughter, without any manifeſt cauſe, nothing could kill, beſides the infection of the commonly inſpired Air.</p>
                     <p>For the Air, which we neceſſarily draw in for the continuance of Life, conſiſts of an heap of vapors and fumes, which are perpetually breathed forth from the Earth; in which the exhalations of Salt and Sulphur, being mingled with the atomical va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous little Bodies, conſtitute here as it were a thick cloud: the motions of theſe are ſwift and unquiet, they are of a manifold figure, and very much diverſe, wherefore ſome continually meet againſt others, and according to their various configurations, they cohere with theſe, and are mutually combined one with another, and from thoſe they are driven, and fly away: from hence the reaſons of the Sympathy and Antipathy of every thing, depend. From the diverſe agitations of theſe kind of Atoms, near the ſuperficies of the Earth, this or that tract of the Air, enters into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe alterations, by which, Bodies, chiefly the living are variouſly affected: becauſe the inteſtine motion, of the Particles of every Animal, depends very much upon the motion and temper of the Particles of the Air: foraſmuch as theſe perpetually exagitate thoſe, raiſe up thoſe lying aſleep, repair the loſs of thoſe flying away, ſhake the vital flame with their Nitroſity, and ſupply it with a Nitrous-Sulphureous Food, eventilates it being inkindled by continual turns of acceſs and receſs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry away the Soot and Fumes. So long as an apt contemperation happens in either, for motion and configuration, living Creatures injoy perfect health and life; but if the little Bodies ſwiming in the Air, be of that ſort of figure and power, that are plainly adverſe to the Spirits implanted in living Creatures, they looſe the mixtures of theſe, from the reſt, from whoſe Elements they are collected, and pervert their motions; hence the diſpoſitions of things are deſtroyed, life profligated, and, the ſame being ſcarce extinct, the Bodies undergoe putrefaction; hence the tops of Trees, or of Corn, being ſtruck with a blaſt, ſuddenly grow dry or wither; hence among Cattel, the murrain often rages, which kills at once whole Flocks; by reaſon of this kind of cauſe, the Seeds of the Peſtilence firſt put themſelves forth, and attempt the ſlaughter of human kind: for as invenomed Bodies in the bowels of the Earth or concreted on its ſuperficies, produce the Arſenical or Aconital mixtures, ſo theſe being even reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into vapour, and heaped together in the Air, create moſt pernitious Airs, from which Malignant and Peſtilential Diſeaſes ariſe; the infection, which after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Contaminates the Air, the moſt ingenious <hi>Diemerbrochius,</hi> a ſearcher of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, contends, that is only ſent (as the wrath of angry <hi>Apollo</hi>) immediately from the angry right hand of God: but this were to multiply without any pretext of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity (I will not ſay beings but) miracles, and in every Plague to aſſert a Creation of new ſubſtance; when in the mean time, the virulent product of Minerals and Vegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, which dayly appear, and of as quite adverſe Nature to us, as the Plague, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifie, that there lives hid in the Bowels of the Earth, plenty of invenomed mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſufficiently fitted for this buſineſs. For the little Bodys, which being roled about with earthy matter, do conſtitute the Poyſonous mixtures in the boſom of the Earth, the ſame being reſolved into vapours, will be no leſs hurtful afterwards, and impreſs a peſtiferous blaſt to the Air, which they wander through: wherefore, by the leave
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:107016:70"/>of ſo Learned a man, I ſhould ſay, that it ſeems not improbable, that the things which firſt of all affix the ſeed plot of the Peſtilence, to any tract of Air, be the Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous <hi>Effluvia</hi> of fierce Salts and Sulphurs, and (by the Divine Will inſtigating) breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth from the bowels of the Earth; which ſomtimes, being a long time before ſhut up, are leiſurely exhaled out of Dens and Caverns; ſomtimes by reaſon of the motion of the Earth, or Earthquake, or a gaping of the Earth, they break forth in heaps; alſo, of the ſame kind, are thoſe which ordinarily are breathed forth from the filth of Souldiers in their naſty Camps; or from unburied Carcaſes; or from places, beſet with ſtanding and ſtinking Mud: but the little Bodies after this manner exhaled, obtain their wonderful height, properties, and abilities, by a long putrefaction, that therefore they are incongruous, and heterogeneous to all others whatſoever, and ſo being received into the Air, ferment it (as it were a maſs of Liquor) and pervert it from a wholſom and benign, into a moſt pernicious and wicked Nature.</p>
                     <p>Some Bodies more eaſily, others not ſo readily receive the malignant tincture of the Peſtilent Air. Thoſe who by reaſon of ill feeding are full of evil humors, and who by reaſon of fulneſs, have their Blood ſtuffed with firable Sulphur, receive the Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Poyſon, by the leſt blaſt of the invenomed Air, eſpecially if fear or ſadneſs hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which convey inwardly, and lead to the Heart, as it were by a certain attraction the moſt light darts of the contagion. On the contrary, thoſe who have their Viſcera clean, and the maſs of Blood well tempered, and are indued with a ſtrong, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs mind, do not ſo eaſily receive this infection, and ſomtimes exterminate it ſoon, being received.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for the beginning and divulgation of the Peſtilence, according to its firſt Fountains, and from thence the ſtream of the infected Air being deduced: it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains for us to ſpeak concerning its propagation by contagion, foraſmuch as it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, as it were extraduce from ſome and ſo to others.</p>
                     <p>We underſtand by Contagion, that force or action, by which any diſtemper reſiding in one Body, excites its like in another. But as this may happen, either immediately by contact, as when any one lying in the ſame bed with another, taken with the Plague, or mediately, and at a diſtance, as when it happens that the infection is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from one houſe to others remote, or alſo if the Plague come upon any one, after many days or months, perhaps years handling a Garment, or houſe-hold ſtuff, brought from an infected houſe: therefore that the Nature of the Contagion, and its diverſe modes may be plainly made known, we will firſt weigh what that is, which ſtreams from an infected Body. Secondly, how it bears it ſelf through the Medium of its paſſage. Thirdly, by what means it begets a diſtemper like it ſelf, in another Body.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That from every Body, altho of a more fixt Nature, <hi>Effluvia</hi> of Atoms conſtantly fly away, and run forth, which round about conſtitute as it were a Cloud or Halos, and as it were cloath it, like the down of a Peach, is ſo much received among the more ſound Philoſophers, that nothing can be more. But by how much the more any thing conſiſts of active Particles, by ſo much the more, it ſends from it ſelf, little Bodies of more remarkable virtue and energy. Hence the <hi>Effluvia</hi> which fall from Ambers, are able to move other Bodies from their place: emanations proceed from Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous things, which fill the whole neighbourhood with odors. And ſo when the Peſtilential venom, as hath been already ſaid, is from hence any where fixed, and tho in the ſmalleſt bulk, is of great efficacy and operation, there is a neceſſity, that ſome emanations, proceed from the Bodies imbued with it, which refer the nature or diſpoſition of the ſame Poyſon and malignity, and diffuſe them on every ſide according to its ſphear of activity. But when theſe little Bodies, which retain the contagion of the Peſtilence, as they ſtream from one Body, are not preſently received by another, we ſhall inquire, how they carry themſelves, in reſpect of their paſſage, through the medium.</p>
                     <p>Where we ſhall preſently meet with a difference in thoſe, from many others, for that the <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which ordinarily evaporate, do not long retain the Nature or Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Body, from which they flow, but either vaniſh into Air, or being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to other Bodies, are aſſimilated to them: but thoſe Particles, which fall from a Peſtilential Infection, are not eaſily ſupped up by the Air, or any other Body, ſo as they may be wholly deſtroyed; but among the various confuſions of Atoms, and the daſhings of other Bodies, they keep themſelves untouched, For this untamed Poyſon remains ſtill the ſame almoſt, and not to be overcome by others, and tho it conſiſts of never ſo little heap of Atoms, will not preſently vaniſh; but with its ferment, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bues the next little Bodies, and ſo acquires new forces, and gains ſtrength by going; from whence it lurks a long while in ſome neſt, and after a long time, when it aſſaults
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:107016:70"/>a convenient ſubject, puts forth it ſelf, and imparting the taint of its Poyſon to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, raiſes up again the Diſeaſe of the Peſtilence anew, which ſeemed before to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded, and tho from the ſmalleſt ſeminary, ſprinkles far and near its deadly Poyſon.</p>
                     <p>For the Peſt, brings forth ſuch moſt ſure ſigns of its contagion, that ſome Authors contend, that for this reaſon it only continues among Mortals, and doth never ſpring up anew, but is only conſerved from its neſt, and carried from thence, from one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to another. Hiſtories relate, that the ſeeds of this have lain aſleep for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years, in ſome Garment or Bedcloaths, and that afterwards, they being ſtirred, it hath appeared, and hath ſtirred up anew the Diſeaſe of the Peſtilence, increaſing with a mighty ſlaughter of men. When by reaſon of the tinder, or cheriſhing neſt, the Plague is propagated after this manner, at a diſtance, the invenomed little Bodies, which remain in the infection, being moved, preſently leap out, and unfold its Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon every way, as it were by a certain irradiation: if that they ſtrike againſt an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, preſently they lay hold on the Spirits, and are by their Vehicle conveyed inwardly, and then by an eaſie labour, they infect the Blood and Humors, whereſoever flowing in the Veſſels, with their ferment, and quickly bring to them coagulations and putrefaction. And after this manner, through the moſt ſubtil <hi>Effiuvia,</hi> is made as it were a certain tranſmigration of the Peſtilential Diſeaſe, even as when a ſhoot being cut off from ſome Tree, and laid up for a time, and afterwards ingrafted to another Trunk, tho from the ſmalleſt bud, it is able to produce a Tree of the ſame Kind and Nature.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIII.</hi> Of the Plague.</head>
                     <p>THus far we have diſcourſed of Poyſon in general, alſo of the Peſtilence, its beginning and propagation by contagion: it now remains, that we expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the deſcription of the Plague, its Nature, according to its accidents, and ſymptoms, moſt worthy of note; then ſome things ſhall be added, which belong to its Cure.</p>
                     <p>The Plague may be deſcribed after this manner, that it is an Epidemical Diſeaſe, Contagious, highly infeſtous to human kind; taking its beginning from an invenomed Infection, received firſt by the Air, and then propagated by Contagion; which having hiddenly and largely ſet upon men, cauſes extinctious of the Spirits, coagulations of the Blood, blaſtings, mortifications or deadneſſes of the ſolid parts, and with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances of whelks, buboes, or carbuncles, as alſo with the horrid proviſion of other ſymptoms, brings the ſick in danger of life.</p>
                     <p>Altho the Plague be one kind of Diſeaſe, and its ſpecifical differences, or eſſential are not found, yet by reaſon of the divers kinds of accidents, which come upon it, ſome diverſities and irregularities of it are obſerved, which ſomthing vary the type of the Diſeaſe, tho they change not the ſpecies. For firſt this diſtemper ſomtimes is more univerſal that it rages every where through many Vilages and Cities at once; but ſomtimes it is circumſcribed in narrower bounds, and only threatens one Region or Tract of Land. Secondly, ſomtimes the Plague comes ſimple, and unmixt with other Diſeaſes, wherefore privily, and as it were by ſurpriſe, almoſt without a Feaver, or vehemency of ſymptoms, brings a ſecret killing of the ſick. Somtimes it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated, with a number of other Diſeaſes, that the buſineſs is carried with tumult and frequent skirmiſhing between Nature and Death. Thirdly, the degree of malignity conſtitutes a great difference; for the Plague in ſome places, and times is much more mild, that many of the ſick eſcape; ſomtimes it is highly mortal, that moſt taken are killed, and that ſcarce one of an hundred recovers.</p>
                     <p>But becauſe this Diſeaſe hides its weapons, and coming on men unawares, kills them ſuddenly, therefore it ſhall be our work, that by ſome ſigns, as it were watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men planted, we may know the Clandeſtine coming of this enemy, altho we are not able to foreſee it from afar. Very many ſigns happen, which foretel ſhortly a Plague about to come: to wit, if the year keeps not its Temper, but has immoderate, and very unſeaſonable exceſſes, either of heat or cold, or of dryneſs or wet; if the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:107016:71"/>ſmall-pox or Meaſles, do every where rage; if Boils or Buboes, accompauy reigning Feavers. Beſides Aſtrologers are wont, from the Aſpects of the Stars, or appearances of Comets, to predict the approaching Plague, but this ought rather to be called a vain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture, than a certain foreknowledge. From a preceeding Famine, a moſt certain pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage may be taken, of a Plague to follow, as in the Adage-<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. The Plague comes with the Famine. For the like Conſtitution of the year, which for the moſt part, by reaſon of the Corn being blaſted, brings ſcarcity, is apt alſo to produce the Plague: alſo, an evil way of feeding which people in dearths uſe, eating all unwholſom things, without choice, diſpoſes their Bodies, to the more eaſie receiving the Infection. Yea, alſo earth-quakes freſh openings of Caverns, and ſecret Vaults, by the gaping of the Ground, by reaſon of the eruptions of malignant and impoyſoned Airs, often give beginning to the Peſtilence. For indeed, as there is need of great diligence, to foreſee, as it were from a watch-Tower, the approaching Plague, ſo there is no leſs need of care and diligence, to conſider, or take notice of the ſame, being freſh riſen, and the ſhooting of its firſt darts: For oftentimes, being too ſolicitous, we dread vulgar Feavers, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance they end in death, for this Diſeaſe; and ſomtimes being too ſecure, contemning the Peſtilence, by reaſon of its Symptoms, like to a common Feaver, we apprehend not our danger, till too late; wherefore, for the more full knowledge of this Diſeaſe, we will ſubjoyn its Signs and Symptoms both common, and Pathognomic or peculiar, and briefly deſcribe their cauſes, means, and manner of being done.</p>
                     <p>Beſides the ſigns already delivered, which by a certain demonſtration <hi>à priori</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand, bring a ſuſpicion of the Plague about to come, there are others, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of which, plainly ſhew its preſence, in the ſick body: of theſe, ſome are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Plague, with a Putrid Feaver, ſome are more proper to this diſtemper. For the impreſſion of the Peſtilence, moſt often ſtirs up an effervency of the Blood, and ſo has frequently a Feaver joyned with it, that among ſome, in the definition of the Plague, it hath the place of a kind of Feaver; wherefore, by reaſon of the ebulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, and the hurt brought to the Viſcera, preſently there follows, a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, thirſt, a burning of the precordia, often great Vomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, pains of the Heart, torments of the Inteſtines, a ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, or a blackneſs, a pain of the head, watchings, Phrenſie, palpitation of the Heart, ſwooning, and ſudden loſs of ſtrength: tho Feavers are moſt often beſet, with theſe kind of Symptoms, yet if at the ſame time, the Plague hath ſpread in the neighbourhood, and a fear of it hath poſſeſſed the minds of men, hence a greater ſuſpition of this evil is cauſed, eſpecially, becauſe, whilſt the Peſtilence reigns, other Diſeaſes in any one, leave their proper Nature, and change into it: wherefore, if there happens to the diſtempers but now recited, a Communication of the ſame ſickneſs to many, and a frequency of Burials, that it becomes every where very deadly, and ſpreads largely even by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and if beſides, Buboes, Carbuncles, Spots, or other marks of the peſtiferous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection appear, the buſineſs is put without doubt, and we may with no leſs faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce it the Peſtilence, than when we ſee an houſe flaming, with fire breaking through the Raftures, we cry out Fire. But becauſe here is mention made of Buboes, Carbuncles, and of other Symptoms, (of which we have already ſpoken, where we treated of Putrid Feavers) it remains, that we briefly touch the cauſes of them, and the manner of their being made: They are theſe: A Carbuncle, a Bubo, Whelks, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamations, and malignant Puſtles.</p>
                     <p>Concerning theſe in common, we ſay, that they are all produced of the Blood, and nervous juice, touched with the peſtiferous Poyſon, and coagulated in parts, in their circuit, and diſtempered variouſly with putrefaction; foraſmuch as the Spirits, reſiding in either Liquor, eſpecially in the Blood, are no ſooner profligated, by the blaſt of this malignant Diſeaſe, but a coagulation is induced to the remaining Liquor, even as milk growing ſour, or when ſome acid juice is poured to it; wherefore, portions of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more grievouſly touched with the Poyſon, they ſoon curdle or grow into gobbets, and ſuffer corruption with blackneſs, like Blood out of the Veſſels; from whence, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently they hinder the motion of the reſt of the Blood in the Veſſels, and in the Heart, and by means of its ferment, more coagulate it; but whatſoever by congelation grows into curdled gobbets, unleſs it be preſently caſt out of doors, cauſes death quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by reſtraining the circulation of the Blood; and being thruſt forth outwardly, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſuperficies of the body, it is ſtopped in its motion, between the narrow wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Veſſels; and being wholly deſtitute either of Spirit, or being ſtruck by a blaſting, produces its deadneſs, black and blew ſpots, and black or purple marks; or, by reaſon of the Salt and Sulphur, being exalted, by the peſtilential ferment, and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting new things, grow together into tumors of a various kind.</p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:107016:71"/>
                     <p>A Carbuncle, or Fiery Inflamation, is a fiery Tumor, with moſt ſharp and burning Puſtules round about it, and infeſting the ſick, with an acute pain; which ariſing in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious places ſeverally, will not be ripened, but creeping more abroad on the ſuperficies, burns the skin, and at length ſhakes off the lobes, or gobbets of its Corruption, and leaves an hollow ulcer, as if burnt by an Eſcharotick or burning Plaſter.</p>
                     <p>The generation of Plague-ſores, ſeem to be made after this manner, when Poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous infections do ſtrike into the Blood, in its own nature torrid, portions of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, are fixed in the ſuperficies of the Body; and in that place, becauſe the motion of the Blood is a little hindred, a tumour at firſt ſmall, is induced; which afterwards, by a malignant ferment, unfolding it ſelf more largely, being leiſurely increaſed, creeps into the neighbouring part: A ſuppuration follows not, becauſe the matter being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travaſated, and ſtagnating, is not concocted and digeſted by a gentle heat, but by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the particles of the outrageous Sulphur, together with the carried forth Salt, being heaped up in theſe Tumors, and becauſe of the ſtagnation, they being preſently looſened from the mixture, a burning is excited, as if a Cautery were affixed to the part: pieces and lobes of skins, eaten as it were from a covered Eſchar, fall off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Corroſive venom, impacted in the Muſcles, gnaws not only to the ſuperficies, but thoſe that lie tranſvers through the whole ſubſtance; wherefore, before all the fleſh is conſumed, with the membranes, in which the eaten pieces were invalved, ſome piece, as it were cut off from the reſt falls away. A Carbuncle, oftentimes but one, oftentimes more ariſe: ſomtimes they are alone, ſomtimes they are accompanied with a Bubo.</p>
                     <p>A peſtilent Bubo ſprings forth, only in glandulous places, into whoſe ſubſtance goes, not only the Blood congealed by the Poyſon, and carried through the Arteries, but the nervous juice heaped up there, and carried back into the Veins. Becauſe this Tumor happens from leſs torrid juices, and in part more frigid, therefore it partakes of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration. For the matter being leiſurely heaped together, when (by reaſon of the ſtagnation, the vital Spirit being departed) it had loſt the form of Blood, it was by a long concoction converted into matter, from the particles of Salt and Sulphur exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reſtrained in the Tumor. But that theſe Tumors only happen in the Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulas, the reaſon is, not that by the deſtination of Nature, the neſt or tinder of the Diſeaſe, is carried to theſe parts, but as the particles of the virulent infection, abound every where in the Blood, and nervous juice, they are more readily gathered together, as in a common Family, and where the Blood being dilated to the extream parts of the Arteries, and is ſo not readily received, and carried back by the veins, and alſo the alible juice, to be carried back from the nerves, into the veins, is depoſed: either of theſe, as it appears clearly, by late obſervations of Anatomiſts, and by experience, are made or done about the Glandulas; wherefore, when in theſe parts, either humors, being ſtuffed with the peſtilent feeds of the contagion, come together at once, as it were the neſt of the malignity, becauſe of the virulency here depoſed from either, is blown up.</p>
                     <p>Whelks, fiery inflamations, and purple ſpots, in reſpect of the venom, are of the ſame ſtuff, as the Tumors but now deſcribed: but in theſe, the product of the viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, conſiſts in a leſſer ſubſtance, yet with greater danger, by reaſon of the ſeeds of the Poyſon, being more diſperſed: more ſmall portions of the coagulated Blood being fixed in the skin, conſtitute theſe leſſer appearances, wherefore, out of theſe, ſome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing increaſed, are ripened into little itching bliſters: others, by reaſon of a certain blaſting, or deadneſs of the corrupted Blood, grow into black and blew, and purple Spots.</p>
                     <p>Altho the Plague, by reaſon of its ſudden, ſecret, and very ſwift aſſault upon ſick people, hardly gives time or place, for a prognoſtick, and when this Diſeaſe, by reaſon of the occult manner of hurting, contains in it ſelf nothing that is not ſuſpected, yet there are ſome ſigns, that appear in its courſe, by which we are wont to foretel, either Life or Death. The buſineſs is then deſperate, if the Diſeaſe paſs preſently into an Epidemical diſtemper, and makes violent aſſaults; if that bleeding, or only a ſmall ſweat follows, in the beginning of the Diſeaſe; if the Urine be thick and troubled, the Pulſe unequal, and weak; if a Convulſion, or a Phrenſie preſently follow; if the Vomits, or Stools are blewiſh, black, or highly ſtinking; if the Whelks at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract a redneſs, afterwards a blewneſs; if the Carbuncles are many; if the Buboes at firſt ſwelling up, diſappear; if ſtrength be ſuddenly loſt, the face horrid, or grows black and blew; if with a ſhivering of the outward parts, there be an heat of the bowels, eſpecially if theſe, or many of them happen in a body full of ill humors, or in an unwholſom ſeaſon. On the contrary, the ſick may be bid to be of good chear, if the condition of the Peſtilence be lighter, and leſs deadly; if the Diſeaſe happens in
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:107016:72"/>a robuſt and healthful body, with a ſtrong mind; if remedies may be timely had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Diſeaſe hath poſſeſſed the whole maſs of Blood. Alſo, if with a continuance of ſtrength, high and equal Pulſe, a ſuppuration of the Buboes, and a large profuſion of matter, with the abſence of more horrid Symptoms, the courſe of the Diſeaſe is performed: In the mean time, altho here we may hope all good, yet we are not to be ſecure, becauſe, ſomtimes the ſnares of life, are laid privily, with the laudable appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of ſigns, and we ſuffer moſt grievouſly as from a reconciled Enemy, whoſe fierce threatnings we ſeemed to have ſhun'd.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the curing of very many ſickneſſes, the buſineſs is chiefly committed to Nature, to whoſe neceſſity, Phyſick is the Midwife: and the office, and ſcience of a Phyſician, chiefly is buſied in theſe, that occaſions of giving convenient aids, to this labouring, be attended, but the Plague hath this peculiar, that its cure is not at all to be left to Nature, but that it is to be endeavoured any way, by remedies gathered from Art. Nor are we to be ſolicitous of a more opportune, or as it were a gentler time, but Medicines are moſt quickly to be prepared, and we muſt not ſtay for them ſome hours, no nor minutes. But becauſe, whilſt the Peſtilence reigns, there is no leſs need of care, that the Contagion may be driven far away, than that the Diſeaſe being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed may be cured, therefore, a double task is incumbent on the Phyſician, to wit, that he looks to the prevention of this malignant Diſeaſe, as well as to the cure. To preſcribe a method for both theſe, had been a work of too much tediouſneſs, and to have given you a diſh a thouſand times dreſſed by Authors, wherefore, we will only touch lightly here, ſome chief Indications, and haſt to other things.</p>
                     <p>Preventive cautions, either reſpect the Republique, and belong to the Magiſtrate, or private perſons, to whom it ſhould be taught, what is to be done by all men, when the Plague is feared.</p>
                     <p>The publique care in the time of the Plague, conſiſts chiefly in theſe, that Divine worſhip be truly obſerved, that all neſts of Putrefaction be cut off, that filths, Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils, and all ſtinking things may be removed out of the Streets, and all occaſion of the Contagion diligently avoided, and that an wholſom means of living be conſtantly obſerved by the Citizens. For which end, the uſe of fruits, and of other unwholſom things ſhould be interdicted: that poor people, who have not plenty or choice of food; ſhould be provided for, at the publique charge: If ſtill the Peſtilence begins to ſpread, the empoyſoned force of the Air ſhould be corrected, as much as may be, which may be beſt done, by the frequent burning of Sulphureous things; the infected ſhould be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the ſound, and the dead Carcaſes, and houſhold-ſtuff ſhould be avoided; and laſtly, that able and fit Phyſicians, and Miniſters be provided for the uſe of the ſound, and the neceſſities of the ſick.</p>
                     <p>The preventive means of a private perſon, is wont to be concluded in theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> Diet, Phyſick, and Chirurgery. Diet reſpects the ſix nonnatural things, among which, of the greateſt moment are, the Air and paſſions of the mind: as to the reſt, <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his precept may ſuffice, <hi>viz.</hi> Labour, Meat, Drink, Sleep, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> ſhould be taken moderately. The Peſtilent Air ſhould be avoided, by going into ſome other place; or corrected by the well burning of Sulphureous things, or whilſt we breath it ſhould be cured by fumigations and ſweet ſmells, often carried near the noſtrils. As to the paſſions of the minds, fear, and ſadneſs, whilſt the Peſtilence rages, are as it were another Plague; for in theſe, the ſeeds of the envenomed Contagion, which are placed in the ſuperficies of the Body, as it were on the edge of a whirlpool, are ſnatched inwardly, by a certain force, and carried to the Heart; wherefore, tis a moſt excellent Antidote, to be of a chearful and confident mind. I have known many, who (as <hi>Helmont</hi> was wont to ſay) by fortifying the Archeus, with Wine and confidence, never uſed any other Poyſon-reſiſting Medicines, and remained without any hurt of the Contagion among the infected: and on the contrary, ſome ſtruck with fear, when they have dwelt far from all Contagion, have drank in the ſeeds of the Peſtilence, as if they were derived from the Stars.</p>
                     <p>Among the Chirurgical things, to be adminiſtred for preſervation ſake, are wont to be commended, the opening of a Vein, Cauteries, and Amulets. Where there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, with a great ſwelling up of the Blood; or in thoſe who conſtantly, by long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom are wont to be let Blood, it is convenient to open a Vein: For the leſs the Blood grows hot, and is circulated without Tumult, in the Veſſels, it will be ſo much the longer, ere it be contaminated, by the peſtiferous Diſeaſe. Iſſues made by Cauteries, are ſo much uſed, almoſt by the ſuffrage of all, for preſervation ſake againſt the Plague, that tis become the moſt common receipt: For theſe by a conſtant tranſmiſſion pour forth the aſſiduous coming of the ſuperfluous and excrementitious matter; and if
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:107016:72"/>that the infections of the Peſtilence be admitted inwardly, they are caſt forth of doors, at theſe open ports.</p>
                     <p>Amulets, hung about the neck, or born on the wriſts, are believed to have a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful force againſt the Peſtilence; of theſe, among ſome, of the greateſt eſteem, are ſuch as are made out of Arſnick, quick-ſilver, the pouder of Toads, and other Poyſons. That the ſame in this caſe may be profitable, beſides the obſervations of Phyſicians this reaſon may ſeem to perſuade ſomthing. The <hi>Effluvia,</hi> or atomical little bodies, emerging now from theſe bodies, now reſiding upon theſe, are before affirmed to fly about through the whole Region of the Air; theſe, as they are diverſly figured, ſome of them eaſily cohere with others, but if they ſtrike againſt ſome of another form, they oppoſe and overturn them: hence, the particles of the peſtilent Infection, which are adverſe to our Spirits, excellently agree with thoſe little bodies of Poyſon placed near, and are readily fixed to them: wherefore, the Amulets made of Poyſon do this, <hi>viz.</hi> They receive the ſeeds of the Peſtilence meeting us, into themſelves, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the likeneſs of parts; alſo, by alluring the ſame from our bodies, into their embraces, they in ſome meaſure, free the infected from the infection.</p>
                     <p>The Medicinal prevention hath a twofold ſcope: Firſt, that the aſſiduous coming of the excrementitious matter or humors be taken away by a gentle purging, as often as there is need: Secondly, that by the daily taking Poyſon-reſiſting Medicines, our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and Body may be fortified againſt the aſſault of the Poyſon: By the former, the Food and cheriſhers, of which encreaſe putrefaction brought in by the Poyſon are drawn away; by the latter, the firſt inkindling of the peſtiferous Infection, as it were a deadly fire, is inhibited. Alexipharmies or Medicines contrary to Poyſons ſeem to be helpful againſt the contagion of the Plague for this twofold Reaſon; Both becauſe the maſs of Blood and Viſcera being filled with the particles of theſe, and alſo the Spirits before poſſeſſed with the ſame, they do not eaſily admit of the company of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyſoned Infection; alſo, becauſe the Blood being incited by the gentle fury of theſe is kept from coagulation.</p>
                     <p>Thus much for preſervation, it follows now, that we ſpeak of the cure of the Plague. The doctrine of which, is either general, and comprehends remedies, which for this end, are taken from Diet, Chirurgery, and Medicine; or ſpecial, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers the uſe, and Cautions to be exhibited, about thoſe Remedies; and by what mens we are to oppoſe the Symptoms variouſly ariſing.</p>
                     <p>Diet comprehends the uſe of the ſix non-naturals, but the chief care, and medical cautions, are to be given about eating, the primary Indications of this, conſiſt not at one and the ſame time together, but ought to be ſupplyed by turns, according to the nature of the thing, and the exigency of nature. In reſpect of the malignity, and of the loſs of ſtrength, Aliments are to be deſired, which greatly cheriſh the Spirits, and bring a more plentiful nouriſhment: in reſpect of the Feaveriſh diſtemper, a more ſlender refrigerating Diet, and temperating the Blood, ſeems to be required: The Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician muſt regard either, but he may rather intend his Remedies againſt the maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than the Feaver.</p>
                     <p>The helps that belong to Chirurgery, are the opening a Vein, which ſeldom and very cautiouſly ought to be uſed in this Diſeaſe, becauſe the Blood being too much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the Veſſels falling down, ſweat is not ſo eaſily procured; inſtead of this, it is better to uſe Cupping, with ſcarification. For this, and Bliſtering, are rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed for the drawing forth of the Venom; moreover, againſt Buboes, Inflamations, or malignant Ulcers produced by them, Cataplaſms, Fomentations, Plaſters, Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and many other things, to be outwardly applyed, are to be ſought for from Chirurgery, in which ſome Poyſons, as the Electric of Poyſon, are preſcribed by ſome to be admixed; wherefore, preparations of Arsnick, to wit, the oil and balſom of it, are commended by many, in this caſe too of moſt excellent uſe and efficacy.</p>
                     <p>Medicines for the cure of the Plague, are either Evacuators, or Poyſon-reſiſters: The intention of the former is, that the ſerous Latex in the Blood, and the excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious humors, which abound in the Viſcera, be thruſt forth of doors; and together with them, very many particles of the invenomed Infection, every where diſperſed in the Body: But theſe are both Vomitories and Purgers, the uſe of which is more rare, and only in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, alſo Diaphoreticks or ſweating Medicines, which at ſome times may be ſuffered according as there is ſtrength, are to be preſcribed in the Plague: For theſe more fully, and from the whole body at once evacuate, yea, and by agitating the Blood, defend it from Congelation, and as they move from the Center, ſtill to the Circumference, they drive the empoyſoned ferment, alſo the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the Blood and humors, far from the heart, and ſo chaſe the Enemy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:107016:73"/>the Camp. But Vomits, and Purges evacuate leſs univerſally, and by Concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the malignant matter, oftentimes carry it inwardly, and fix it to the Bowels. But theſe Medicines, whether they operate by purging, or ſweating, ought to be of that kind, which have particles, rather agreeable to the empoyſoned infection, than to our Blood or Spirits; for ſuch a Medicine, will paſs through the various windings of our body, with its whole forces and unmixt, and by reaſon of the ſimilitude of either, more certainly takes hold of the virulent matter of the Diſeaſe, and carries it forth of doors with it ſelf, by the mutual adheſion of the parts, which way provoked nature leads. Wherefore, Medicines, whether Catharticks or Sudorificks, are commended before others, which are prepared out of Mercury, Antimony, Gold, Sulphur, Vitriol, Arſnick, and the like; which, when they cannot be ſubjugated by our heat, or maſtered, become the beſt Remedies againſt the Poyſon of a peſtilent Diſeaſe: for theſe do not only potently evacuate ſuperfluous things, but when as they put forth very ſtrong and untameable particles, and explicate them every where in the body, diſſipate the ferments of the Poyſon growing here and there, and hinder them from maturation; and as theſe Remedies, being of themſelves not to be overcome by Nature, are neceſſitated to be carried outwardly through the open paſſages of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they carry forth of doors with them, whatſoever extraneous or hoſtile thing is met with.</p>
                     <p>As to Poyſon-reſiſting Medicines, or Alexiterians, which are ſaid to reſiſt the Poyſon of this Diſeaſe, without any ſenſible evacuation, they are (for the moſt part) ſuch, whoſe particles are not very much of kin to Nature, ſo as to goe into Aliment; nor ſo diverſe, as to provoke to an excretion. The ſame being inwardly taken, and broken into the ſmalleſt pieces, inſpire the Blood, and juices flowing together in the Veſſels, and Viſcera, with their little bodies, as with a new ferment, and by moving the ſame gently, and by keeping them in an equal mixture, defend them from Coagulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Putrefaction; diſſipate the particles begun to be heaped up, one from another, by the ſame gentle agitation, and hinder them from maturity; and laſtly by pre-poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the Blood and Spirits, defend them from the impreſſions of the peſtilent mark. Among theſe, ſome more ſimple Remedies are commended as Rue, Scordium, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but moſt of all by far are eſteemed, thoſe that are compounded, wherefore, Treacle, Mithridate, and Diaſcordium, ſome of which are compos'd of no leſs than fifty ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; that, 'tis eſteemed a crime in Medicines ſo compleat in all numbers, to omit one Plant, or one Dram of them in their Compoſitions; the reaſon perchance is, becauſe very many things being put together, may make a maſs, whoſe diverſe kinds of particles being exalted, by long digeſtion, may ſtir up the greater fermentation in our Blood and humors.</p>
                     <p>Having after this manner ranked the Remedies, in which we ought to be inſtructed, for the curing of the Plague; now next we ſhould ſpeak of the method of cure, <hi>viz.</hi> What firſt, and then what next, ſhould be done in order: but that this Diſeaſe hath ſo precipitous a Courſe, that there is neither place for deliberation, nor is there frequently any Phyſician to be gotten, for fear of the Contagion; wherefore, there is no need here of of many preſcripts, or a long feries of Indications; this buſineſs is to be quickly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and may be comprehended in a few things. Therefore, when the peſtilence reigning, any one is diſtempered with the Contagion of this Diſeaſe, the help of the omnipotent God being requeſted by Prayers, preſently Remedies are to be flown to: If the Plague happens in a body not throughly purged, and prone to Vomiting, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently let a Vomit be taken, whoſe operation being finiſhed, immediatly let a ſweat be provoked, by taking Diaphoreticks, and the ſame continued as ſtrength can bear it, and afterwards be often repeated. Beſides, let Alexipharmicks or Poyſon-reſiſters, be uſed almoſt every moment, until by the eruption of Whelks, Inflamations, or Buboes, all the Venom be wholly driven forth of doors: but in the mean time, proper and reſpective Remedies, are to be oppoſed to the moſt urging Symptoms: but eſpecially, fit helps are to be fought from Chirurgery, for the cure of the Buboes, and Plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſores: the whole weight of this buſineſs, leans on theſe two Intentions, that the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous Poyſon may be every way expelled from within, and then, that the recourſe of what is driven forth, be with equal diligence prevented.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Plague, we cannot ſo readily write examples, and hiſtories of ſick perſons, with exact diaries of the Symptoms: becauſe theſe kind of ſickneſſes came not every year, neither when they ſpread, is it lawful for every Phyſician that takes care of his own health, frequently to viſit the ſick, or to ſtay long with them, whereby he may denote all accidents, and diligently conſider the reaſons of them; which task however, the renowned Diemerbrochius, did ſo firmly perſiſt in, that after him, others
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:107016:73"/>may lawfully be ſuperſeded from this work: when ſomtimes paſt, in this City, <hi>viz.</hi> 1645. the Plague (tho not great) had ſpread, Doctor <hi>Henry Sayer,</hi> a very learned Phyſician, and happy in his practice, many others refuſing this province, boldly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all the ſick, poor, as well as rich, daily adminiſtred to them Phyſick, and handled with his own hands, their Buboes, and virulent Ulcers, and ſo cured very many ſick, by his ſedulous, tho dangerous Labour. That he might fortifie himſelf againſt the Contagion, before he went into the infected houſes, he was wont only to drink a large draught of Sack, and then his perambulation about the borders of Death, and the very jaws of the Grave being finiſhed, to repeat the ſame Antidote; After he had in this City, as if inviolable as to the Plague, a long while taken care of the affairs of the Sick without any hurt, he was ſent for to <hi>Walling ford</hi>-Caſtle, where this Diſeaſe cruelly Raged, as another Aeſculapius, by the Governour of the place: But there being ſo bold, as to lye in the ſame Bed; with a certain Captain (his intimate Companion) who was taken with the Plague, he quickly received the Contagion of the ſame Diſeaſe: nor were the Arts then profitable to the Maſter, which had been helpful to ſo many others, but there, with great ſorrow of the Inhabitants, nor without great loſs to the Medical Science, he dyed of that Diſeaſe. As to others, diſtempered by the Peſtilence, he was wont to order this kind of method of healing, if he was ſent for before the Buboes or Whelks appeared outwardly, for the moſt part he gave a Vomit, the preſcriptions of which were of the Infuſion of <hi>Crocus Metallorum,</hi> ſomtimes with white, and ſomtimes with Roman <hi>Vitriol:</hi> The Vomiting being ended he commanded them to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put into a ſweat by the taking of Diaphoreticks; and thence, ſome intervals being granted, for the recovery of ſtrength, the ſweating to be continued to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the Diſeaſe: but if he were ſent for to the ſick, after the appearances of the marks, the Vomiting being let alone, he inſiſted only upon Sudorificks.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XIV.</hi> Of Peſtilential and Malignant Feavers in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and of others Epidemical.</head>
                     <p>AFter having unfolded the Nature of the Plague, by the order of our Tract, we ought to proceed to the Diſeaſes, which ſeem to be neareſt like its Nature; which chiefly are Feavers, called Peſtilent and Malignant; for tis commonly noted, that Feavers ſomtimes reign popularly, which for the vehemency of ſymptoms, the great ſlaughter of the ſick, and the great force of contagion, ſcarce give place to the Peſtilence; which however, becauſe they imitate the type of Putrid Feavers, and do not ſo certainly kill the ſick as the Plague, or ſo certainly infect others, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name not of the Plague, but by a more minute appellation of a Peſtilential Feaver: Beſides theſe, there are Feavers of another kind, the perniciouſneſs and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion of which appear more remiſs, yet, becauſe they are infeſtous, beyond the force of Putrid Feavers, and ſeem to contain in themſelves in a manner, the <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> or hand of God of Hippocrates, are yet by a more ſoft appellation, called Malignat Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe Feavers differ both from the Peſt, and from one another according to the degree, and vehemency of contagion and deadlyneſs: as the Plague is a Diſeaſe highly contagious, and deadly to human kind; tis the Peſtilent Feaver, which commonly ſpreads with a leſſer diffuſion of its infection, and frequency of burials. When the infection is only ſuſpected, and the Criſis happens beyond the event of vulgar Feavers, only not to be truſted or leſs ſafe, tis eſteemed for a Malignant Feaver. They are yet more fully deſcribed thus.</p>
                     <p>When the Feaver commonly ſpreads abroad, which for the variety of ſymptoms, puts on the likeneſs of the Putrid Feaver ſo caled, to wit, when there are preſent, Thirſt, Burning, Wearineſs, Anxiety, roughneſs of the Tongue, Watchings, Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, Vomiting, want of Appetite, Syncopy, Swooning, Heart-pains, and a concourſe of other moſt terrible accidents; if there happen beſides, ſpots either like to the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Flea-bites, or broad ones like black and blew ſtrokes, and livid, we eſteem this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe of an evil Nature. If beſides theſe, it is not cured after the wonted manner of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:107016:74"/>Feavers, but that the ſtrength of the ſick is caſt down, without any manifeſt cauſe, and that death comes often unlooked for and unſuſpected, againſt the Prognoſtic of the Phyſician, there is yet a greater cauſe of ſuſpicion of malignity: But if it kills very many of the ſick, and that thoſe who converſe with the ſick, contract the evil of the ſame Diſeaſe, that the ſame Diſeaſe ſpreads through all the Villages or Cities, it may be ſaid to be more than malignant, a peſtilential Feaver: which is yet fully proved, if it rages in very many ordinarily with a certain common ſymptom, as when a Squinancy, Dyſentery or deadly Sweat, ſuch as in times paſt ſpread in <hi>England,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany theſe ſort of Feavers.</p>
                     <p>If that a Feaver ariſes, which Diſtempers many living in the ſame Region together, almoſt after the ſame manner, which notwithſtanding obſerves the laws of a common Putrid Feaver in its courſe, and is cured almoſt after the ſame manner, this is not ſaid to be Peſtilent, but only a Malignant Feaver; unleſs that in ſome labouring with a remarkable Cacochymy, or fulneſs of ill humors, the appearances of Buboes, or of ſpots, ſomtimes with a deadly Criſis, and a contagion creeping upon others, betray ſome ſigns of Malignity.</p>
                     <p>If it be demanded, to which Claſs of the aforeſaid Feavers, theſe ſort of Peſtilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and Malignant Feavers ought to be placed, we aſcribe them only to the rank of continual Feavers; we diſcharge or acquit intermitting Feavers, becauſe by intervals they grant ſuch firm Truces to Nature, and then they regularly and exactly obſerve their periods, which does not confiſt with an invenomed diſpoſition. Alſo we except Hectic Feavers from malignity, becauſe otherwiſe their mortality would not be ſo long delayed, but that partaking of Poyſon, they would kill ſooner: among continual Feavers, altho we affirm, that the ſimple ſynochal Feavers, are not free, yet they are rarely touched with this evil: but moſt of all, the Feaver which ſhews the notes of peſtility or malignity, is of that ſort, which reſembles the figure of the Putrid Feaver ſo called: for when in theſe Feavers, beſides the appearances of virulency, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a continual growing hot of the Blood, which paſſes through the courſes or ſtadia of beginning, increaſe, ſtanding and declination, as in Putrid Feavers, we deſervedly affirm here, the Sulphureous part of the Blood to be heated and inkindled, and by its burning to have brought in the Feaver: wherefore in theſe kind of Feavers, two things are eſpecially to be noted, the growing hot of the Blood and the malignity joyned with it, of which now this, now that is the greater: alſo, in both there is a great Latitude, and very many degrees of its intenſion or heat, according to which the Feaver becomes more or leſs acute or malignant.</p>
                     <p>The growing hot of the Blood is performed after the ſame manner, as is already ſaid concerning Putrid Feavers: to wit, the Sulphureous part of the Blood growing hot above meaſure, as it were takes fire by its fervor; in the time of its burning it accumulates a great quantity of aduſt marter, upon whoſe ſubaction and ſecluſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the ſtate and Criſis after the wonted manner of Feavers: but beſides theſe, the Blood being infected with a certain venornous taint, in the burning it begins by reaſon of the malignant ferment, to be coagulated into parts, and to putrifie: wherefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the uſual ſymptoms of the common Feaver, by reaſon of ſome congealed porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Blood, follow either deadly Diſtempers, Swooning, a dejection of the Spirits, alſo appearances of ſpots and marks: beſides venomous <hi>Effluvia,</hi> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the ſick, that are able to raiſe up the like Diſtemper in others, by the force of their contagion; wherefore by reaſon of its perniciouſneſs and contagion, and their various degrees, it is called, either a Peſtilent or Malignant Feaver.</p>
                     <p>Alſo whilſt the Blood growing hot, is infected with a venomous and malignant fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not only proper coagulations of its maſs, with a diſpoſition to putrifaction, are induced; but alſo the Nervous Liquor, eaſily contracts the taint of this, from whence it being made improportionate to the Brain and Regiment of the Animal Spirits, ſtirs up great irregularities in them: therefore upon theſe ſort of Feavers, come not only ſpots and whelks, but moſt often a Delirium, Phrenſie, Sleepineſs, Tremblings of the Limbs, Cramps, and Convulſive motions; I have often obſerved, that in ſome certain years, Malignant Feavers have increaſed, which have ſhown their virulency, without the appearances of marks, chiefly about the Nervous ſtock; becauſe in ſome, preſently after the beginning, has followed a ſleepineſs, with a mighty heavineſs of the Head, in others, ſtrong Watchings, a perturbation of mind, with Trembling and Convulſive motions, but in moſt, either none, or only an uncertain Criſis, and inſtead of it, a tranſlation of the Feaveriſh matter to the Brain; beſides it is obſerved, that theſe Feavers creep upon others by contagion, and that very many are killed by them, that therefore they do deſerve to be called Malignant.</p>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:107016:74"/>
                     <p>But theſe kind of Feavers are ſomtimes firſt begun from a venomous infection, and the Blood being touched with the Particles of the venom, conceives of it ſelf an Efferveſcency, and is inkindled; as when from a contagion or malignant Air being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, any one hath fallen into a Malignant Feaver, without any evident cauſe or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition: But ſomtimes the Feaveriſh Diſtemper is induced from a proper cauſe, and then the ſeeds of the Malignity, either lying hid within in the Body, exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Effervent Blood, or they come from another place by the contaminated Air, as it were the Food of the flame before inkindled; for it appears by frequent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation in the time in which an Epidemical Feaver ſpreads, that others being any way ariſen, turn into it.</p>
                     <p>Malignant Feavers, as alſo Peſtilential, for the moſt part are popular, and invade many at once: but ſomtimes they are private, and not ordinary, ſo that perhaps only one or two are taken in the whole Region; in ſuch a caſe, it is to be ſuſpected that they come not from a malignant Air, or Epidemical cauſe, but from a morbous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the Body; for I have often obſerved that when in the Spring or Autumn, a Feaver ſufficiently common, hath ſpread in ſome City or Town, of which very many have dyed, perhaps ſome one on whom an evil prediſpoſition, and a more ſtrong evident cauſe, hath brought the Feaver, hath lain by it, with more horrid ſymptoms, and great notes of malignity: in which caſe that malignity is not to be called common to the Feaver, but not ordinary, and accidental only.</p>
                     <p>Altho the greateſt reaſon of the difference, by which theſe kind of Feavers are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from one another, and from other Feavers, conſiſts in their deadlineſs and contagion; yet ſomtimes, they are noted with a certein peculiar ſymptom, from which they take for that time, both the note of malignity, and the appellation of the name: hence in ſome years an Epidemical Feaver reigns, which induces to moſt of the ſick a Squinancy, another time an inflamation of the Lungs, a Pleuriſie, Dyſentery, or ſome other diſtemper, and that oftentimes moſt dangerous, and contagious: ſo the ſeeds of Diſeaſes, not only derived from the Parents by traduction, excite their fruits as it were by a certain deſignation, in the ſame part or member; but alſo, thoſe received from an Infection commonly ſpreading, produce in all, a diſtemper of the ſame mode and figure: which yet I think to happen, not becauſe the ſeeds of the venomous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, reſpect either this or that Region of the Body, with a certain peculiar Virtue; but theſe ſo affect the maſs of Blood, by a like manner in all, that there is a neceſſity, for the ſake of waſhing away this ſtain, that a Criſis be attempted after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in all. For when, without malignity, the Blood, by reaſon of Coagulation, or perhaps other cauſes, is apt to be extravaſated, the uſual places, in which portions of the ſame being extravaſated, are wont to be fixed, are the Throat, Pleura, Lungs, and Inteſtines: wherefore, 'tis no wonder, when from a malignant cauſe, the congelation of the Blood, and for that reaſon an extravaſation is induced, if the Diſeaſe is neſted in the accuſtomed cheriſhing place of Nature.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the cauſes of theſe kind of Feavers, there is not much buſineſs: they are for the moſt part deduced, in reſpect of the malignity, from the vicious Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air; in reſpect of the Feaveriſh heat, from the morbous proviſion of the Body: either of theſe, are eaſily made clear, by what hath been already ſaid, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Putrid Feaver, and the cauſes of the Peſtilence: If the malignity be ſtronger than the Feaver, and hath induced it, the impreſſion of it is to be imputed to the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Air, or to a Contagion received from others; if the Feaver be firſt, its inkindling is aſcribed to tranſpiration being hindred, to a Surfeit, or to ſome other of the evident cauſes above enumerated.</p>
                     <p>As to the ſigns, beſides contagion and deſtruction, theſe ſhew the malignity of the Feaver, a ſudden loſs of ſtrength, a weak and unequal pulſe, and evil affection of the Brain and nervous parts, being ſuddenly induced, cruel Vomitings, blackneſs of the Tongue, a ſuffuſion of darkneſs through the whole Body, but chiefly the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of Spots, Buboes, and of other marks.</p>
                     <p>For the cure of Feavers, both Peſtilential and Malignant, there is greater need of Judgment, and Circumſpection, than in any others whatſoever: For when there are two primary Indications, to wit, the Malignity, and the Feaveriſh intemperance, and when one can ſcarcely provide for the one, without detriment to the other, it is not eaſily to be diſcerned, which ſhould firſt be helped, or ſooneſt regarded. In reſpect of the Feaver, purging, opening a Vein, and cooling things, do chiefly help; but whilſt theſe are performed, the Malignity, for the moſt part is increaſed, and being neglected, ſpreads abroad more largely its Poyſon: againſt the Malignity, Poyſon-reſiſting Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials, and Diaphoreticks are required, but theſe extreamly heighten the Feaver, they
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:107016:75"/>more ſhake the Blood and Spirits before inkindled, as it were with the blaſt of Bellows, and force all as it were into a flame; wherefore, here is great need of skill, that theſe things be rightly ordered in themſelves, and where there is moſt of danger appearing, thence the Curative Intentions are to be more immediatly deſigned; but ſo, as whilſt one is conſulted about, the other be not neglected. But in theſe caſes, beſides the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Judgment of every Phyſician, experience may ſupply the chief means of healing: for when as theſe Feavers firſt ſpread, every one almoſt tryes ſeveral Remedies, and by the ſucceſs of them collated together, it may be eaſily reckoned, what kind of method is to be relyed on, till at laſt, by a frequent tryal, or the footſteps of thoſe paſſing before, there is made as it were a high and broad Road, for the curing of theſe ſorts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, bounded both with various obſervations and warnings.</p>
                     <p>Beſides theſe ſort of Feavers, which ſpread on many at once, and by reaſon of the Contagion, deadlineſs, and conſpicuous notes of virulency, deſerve to be called Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent or Malignant; there are ſome others, epidemical or popular, which almoſt every year, either in the Spring or Autumn, rage in ſome Countries; of which the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants for the moſt part of them are wont to be ſick, and not few, eſpecially of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to dye: In which notwithſtanding, no ſigns of Peſtilence or Malignity appear, neither does the Diſeaſe ſeem to ſpread, from one and ſo to another, ſo much by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, as to lay hold on many, by reaſon of a prediſpoſition, impreſſed almoſt on all. But theſe kind of diſtempers, depend chiefly upon the foregoing Conſtitution of the year: for if the ſeaſon going before was very intemperate, by reaſon of exceſs of cold or heat, of dryneſs or humidity, and ſo had continued for a long time, it changes our Blood very much, from its due temperature, whereby it is apt afterwards to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Feaveriſh efferveſcencies; and from hence a Feaver, now of this Type or Figure, now of that is produced; which preſently becomes Epidemical, becauſe it draws its beginning from a common cauſe, wherewith the bodies of all, are in a manner affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted: But ſuch Feavers, foraſmuch as they depend upon the Blood having gotten a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, now ſharp, now auſtere, or of ſome other kind, by reaſon of the temper of the year, for the moſt part are of the rank of intermitting Feavers: yet, by a proper proviſion of Symptoms, they are wont to be noted, according to the peculiar Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of every year. Theſe are not able to be comprehended, under a certain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule, or formal reaſon, which may quadrat to the nature of each of theſe; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they vary every year, according to their ſeveral accidents. However, we will give you the deſcriptions of theſe kind of Feavers, ſpreading of late years in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, had at that time, for ſome ſpecimen of the reſt, and add it for a concluſion at the end of this Tract.</p>
                     <p>There yet remains to be aſcribed to the rank of malignant Feavers, ſome other pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Feavers, and participating of no Contagion: of which ſort chiefly are thoſe, which are wont to happen to Child-bearing women, by reaſon of difficult and hard labour, or by reaſon of the ſtoppage of their Courſes. Indeed it ſufficiently appears, by common obſervation, that theſe are very dangerous, and often mortal: for if, by the parts of the Womb being hurt, or by cold being admitted, or perhaps by any other cauſe, the Courſes are ſtopped, and the humour which ought to be thruſt forth, ſhall be confuſed with the maſs of the Blood, it moſt wickedly infects it, as it were with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain venomous mixture; that by that means, preſently a Feaver is excited, which with an evil proviſion of Symptoms, is very much beſet, <hi>viz.</hi> with heat, and cruel thirſt, Vomiting, pain of the Heart, and watchings, and for the moſt part obtains, either no Criſis, or a very difficult one: becauſe, unleſs the wonted way of the flux of the Courſes, may be at length reſtored, it is wont, after the heat of the Blood hath been continued for ſome days, to Communicate the evil to the Brain, and nervous ſtock; from whence, by and by, a Delirium, Phrenſie, Convulſions, and other moſt wicked diſtempers, are moſt often induced, which do not ſeldom end in Death: but theſe ſort of Feavers deſerve a peculiar conſideration which we have more fully determined to ſhew hereafter in a particular diſcourſe concerning this buſineſs; in the mean time, we will undertake to propoſe ſome inſtances or examples of the Feavers, but now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Peſtilent, and Malignant.</p>
                     <p>The peſtilent Feaver, of late years, hath more rarely ſpread in theſe Regions, than the Plague it ſelf: of the only one of this kind, which fell under our obſervation, I will give you a brief deſcription. In the year 1643, when in the coming on of the Spring, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> beſieged <hi>Reading,</hi> being held for the King, in both Armies there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a Diſeaſe to ariſe very Epidemical; however, they perſiſting in that work, till the beſieged were forced to a ſurrender, this Diſeaſe grew ſo grievous, that in a ſhort time after, either ſide left off, and from that time, for many months, fought not with the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:107016:75"/>Enemy, but with the Diſeaſe: as if there had not been leiſure to turn aſide to another kind of Death, this deadly Diſeaſe increaſing, they being already overthrown by Fate, and as it were falling down before this one Death. <hi>Eſſexe</hi>'s Camp moving to the <hi>Thomes,</hi> pitched in the places adjacent, where he ſhortly loſt a great part of his men: But the King returned to <hi>Oxford,</hi> where at firſt, the Souldiers being diſpoſed in the open Fields, then afterwards among the Towns and Villages, ſuffered not much leſs: For his Foot, (which it chiefly invaded) being pact together in cloſe houſes, when they had filled all things with filthineſs, and unwholſom naſtineſs, and ſtinking odors (that the very Air ſeemed to be infected) they fell ſick by Troops, and as it were by Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons. At length the Feaver now more than a Camp Feaver invaded the unarmed and peaceable Troops, to wit, the entertainers of the Souldiers, and generally all others, yet at firſt (the Diſeaſe being yet but lightly inflicted) tho beſet with an heavy and long languiſhment, however many eſcaped. About the Summer Solſtice this Feaver began alſo to increaſe with worſe proviſion of Symptoms, and to lay hold on the Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, and others inhabiting the Country. Then afterwards, ſpread through our City, and all the Country round, for at leaſt Ten miles about. In the mean time, they who dwelt far from us, in other Counties remained free from hurt, being as it were without the ſphere of the Contagion. But here this Diſeaſe became ſo Epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal that a great part of the people was killed by it; and aſſoon as it had entred an houſe, it run through the ſame, that there was ſcarce one left well to adminiſter to the ſick; ſtrangers, or ſuch as were ſent for to help the ſick, were preſently taken with the Diſeaſe; that at length, for fear of the Contagion, thoſe who were ſick of this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, were avoided by thoſe who were well, almoſt as much, as if they had been ſick of the Plague.</p>
                     <p>Nor indeed, did there a leſs mortality, or ſlaughter of men, accompany this Diſeaſe: becauſe Cachectic, and Pthiſical old men, or otherways unhealthful, were killed by it; alſo not a few of Children, young men, and thoſe of a more mature and robuſt age. I remember in ſome Villages, that almoſt all the old men dyed this year, that there were ſcarce any left, who were able to defend the manners and priviledges of the Pariſh, by the more anciently received Traditions.</p>
                     <p>When this Feaver firſt began, it was ſomthing like the figure of a putrid Synochus; but it was harder to be cured, and when it ſeemed to be helped by a ſweat or looſneſs, preſently it was wont to be renewed again: but for the moſt part, after the deflagrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Blood, continued for ſix or ſeven days, this remitting, and inſtead of a Criſis the aduſt matter being tranſlated to the Brain, the ſick for a long time keeping their Beds with raging ſomtimes, but more often with a ſtupefaction, with great weakneſs, and ſomtimes with Convulſive motions, ſcarcely eſcaped at laſt. About the middle of the Summer, beſides the Contagion and frequent burials, this Diſeaſe betrayed its malignity, and peſtilential force in open ſigns, <hi>viz.</hi> By the eruption of Whelks and Spots: becauſe about this time in many there appeared without any great burning of the Feaver, an unequal, weak, and very much diſordered pulſe; alſo without a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt expenſe of Spirits, their ſtrength preſently became languiſhing, and very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: In others, ſick after the ſame manner, appeared little Bliſters or Meaſles, now ſmall and red, now broad and livid: in many, Buboes, (as in the Plague) about the glandulas: of theſe ſome died ſilently and unforeſeen, without any great ſtrugling of the Spirits, or Feaveriſh burning excited in the Blood: in the mean time others, by and by becoming furibundous, whilſt they lived ſuffered moſt horrid diſtractions, of the animal Spirits. Thoſe about to eſcape from this Diſeaſe, without any laudible Criſis, (unleſs they were the ſooner freed by a ſweat provoked by Art) the Brain, and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock becoming diſtempered, at length, with a benummedneſs of the ſenſes, tremblings, vertigo, debility of the members, and Convulſive motions, did not grow well but of a long time after. During the Dog-days, this Diſeaſe being ſtill infeſtous, began to be handled not as a Feaver, but as a leſſer Plague, and to be overcome only by Poyſon-reſiſting Remedies; letting of Blood, was believed to be fatal to this: Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, and Purges, ſomtimes tho not often, were made uſe of, but the chiefeſt means of Cure, were accounted to be procured by Alexiteriums, and timely ſweat. For this end, beſides the preſcripts, of Phyſicians, to be had at the Apothecaries, ſome Emperical Remedies deſerved no ſmall praiſe; then firſt of all, the pouder of the Counteſs of <hi>Kent,</hi> began to be of great eſteem in this Country; alſo of no leſs note was another pouder, of the colour of Aſhes, which a certain Courtier ſtaying by chance in this City, gave to many with good ſucceſs; and to others approving of the uſe of it, he ſold it at a great price; the ſick were wont having taken half a dram of this, in any Liquor, to fall into a moſt plentiful ſweat, and ſo to be freed from the virulency of the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:107016:76"/>Diſeaſe; That Diaphoretick (whoſe preparation I afterwards learnt, from the Couſen German of the Author) was only the pouder of Toads, purged throughly with Salt, and then wſhed in the beſt Wine, and lightly calcined in an earthen Pot. The Autumn coming on, this Diſeaſe by degrees remitted its wonted fierceneſs that fever grew ſick of it and of them many grew well; till the approach of the Winter, when this Feaver almoſt wholly vaniſhed, and health was rendred to this City, and the Country round about fully and wholly.</p>
                     <p>Thus you have ſeen the beginning, progreſs, and end of this Feaver, at firſt only a Camp Feaver, but at length became Peſtilential, and Epidemical. That at firſt the Diſeaſe began in the Souldiers Camp, may ſeem to be imputed, not only to their naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſtinking ſmells, but in ſome ſort to a common vice of the Air, for as theſe Feavers come not every year, their original may be aſcribed, partly to the peculiar Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the year. Becauſe, by that means, a more light intemperance of the Air being contracted, tho it did not affect the more healthful Inhabitants; yet in the Army, where evident cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> errors in the ſix non-naturals, very much happen to the general procatartic cauſe, there is a neceſſity for theſe kind of ſickneſſes eaſily to be excited. For the conſtitution of this year, was in the Spring very moiſt, and ſlab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, almoſt with continual ſhours, to which a mnore hot Summer Succeeding, and the infection of the Feaveriſh Contagion here firſt increaſing, ſtill grew worſe, and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all Bodies the more for the receiving it; wherefore, that this Diſeaſe was almoſt proper to this Region, and at this time Epidemical, the ſeed of it ought to be aſcribed to its firſt riſing from the Army, being quartered round about. But foraſmuch, as it afterwards being made Peſtilential, and very Epidemical, it infected moſt of the people living here, and killed not a few, the reaſon was, the evil affection of the Air; which becauſe of the intemperance of the year being unwholſom, beſides by the continual breathing forth of ſtinking vapours from the Souldiers Camps, and the quarters of the ſick, it became at laſt ſo votious, that the infection of the Feaver, being diſperſed in it, was greatly exalted, and aroſe almoſt to the virulency of the Plague. <hi>Diemerbrochius</hi> relates from the like Camp Feaver, ariſing in the Summer at <hi>Spires,</hi> afterwards another Malignant and Peſtilential, and then the Plague it ſelf to have accrewed. Alſo, it was a ſign that this Feaver of ours, became at laſt equal to the Plague it ſelf, beſides the great force of the Contagion, and the frequency of Burials, moſt wicked diſtempers of the Blood, and nervous Liquor, being brought preſently upon all, by it: becauſe, ſtrength being ſuddenly overthrown, the weak intermitting pulſe, the creeping forth of meaſly Bliſters, the eruption of Buboes, argued the Coagulation, and corruptive diſpoſition of the Blood: beſides the Delirium, Madneſs, Phrenſie, Stupefaction, Sleepineſs, Vertigo, Tremblings, Convulſive motions, and divers other diſtempers of the Head, ſhewed the great hurt of the Brain, and nervous ſtock.</p>
                     <p>That the figure, or Idea of this malignant Feaver, may be painted to the life, very many obſervations or hiſtories of ſick people, are eaſily to be had; of the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this Diſeaſe, I ſhall only mention a few, which hapned ſome years ſince in the houſe of a venerable man, and as with a mournful ſlaughter, ſo not without ſome admiration.</p>
                     <p>About the Winter Solſtice, in the year 1653. a youth of about Seven years old, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manifeſt cauſe, found himſelf ill, being troubled with a pain of his Head, Sleepineſs, and mighty Stupefaction; with it he had a Feaver, tho not ſtrong, with an ordinary burning, wich grew more grievous, only by wandring fits, ſomtimes once, ſometimes twice in Twenty four hours ſpace: preſently from the beginning, he ſlept almoſt continually, alſo he was wont in his ſleep to cry out, to talk idly, and to leap often out of his Bed; being awakned, and ſomtimes of his own accord awaking, he preſently came to himſelf, and conſtantly called for drink; his Urine was red, and full of Contents, his pulſe equal, and ſtrong enough; in his wriſts appeared light contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of the tendons, and in his neck, and other parts of his Body, ſome red ſpots like Flea-bites. At the firſt, was ordered a light Purgation, and a frequent taking down of the Belly, by the uſe of Clyſters; he daily took Cordial Julaps, with Poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſters; Veſicatories or bliſtering Plaſters, were applyed to his neck, and other Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the ſoles of his feet: on the ſixth day, a little Blood ſtreamed from his noſtrils; on the ſeventh, without any manifeſt through Criſis, the Feaver very much abated, the heat ſo gentle as to be perceived only by the Touch; alſo, the Urine pale, thin, and without any ſediment, yet he was much more grieviouſly troubled with ſleepineſs, and a ſtupefaction of the Head, ſo that his Urine, and the excrements of his Belly came away involuntarily; however, being called upon, he knew the ſtanders by, and anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to their queſtions; Theſe diſtempers, notwithſtanding the Remedies every day
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:107016:76"/>grew worſe: About the Fourteenth day, the ſick youth became ſo ſtupid, as neither to be able to underſtand, nor to ſpeak, yet he ſwallowed ſtill what was put into his mouth, tho unknowingly, and his pulſe was laudable enough: about this time, he fell into a Flux, excited of it ſelf by Nature for four days, which at laſt ceaſing, a whiteiſh cruſt or ſcurf, and as it were Chaulky, began to ſpread over the whole cavity of his Mouth and Throat, which being often in a day wiped away, new preſently broke forth: when he had thus for four days more been ſick, he became better in his intellect, and ſenſe, ſo that he was able to know his Parents and Friends, to take notice of their words, and to do ſomthing as he was bid: but as his ſenſitiv faculty began to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, ſo he began to grow worſe as to his ſpeech and the Organs of ſwallowing; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the matter being fallen from the Brain, into the beginnings of the Nerves, a Palſie in the Tongue and Throat had ſucceeded to the heavineſs and ſtupefaction: which diſtemper in a ſhort time ſo increaſed, that afterwards the ſick perſon could not ſwallow at all, but that what he took in at the Mouth preſently flowed back again, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could any thing go down into the Stomach; when beſides the cruelty of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, there was danger leaſt he ſhould be killed by Famine, an Inſtrument was prepared of a pin of Chalk, put into a little plaint wand, and on the top of it, a little tuft of ſilk made fit; and this being thruſt down his Throat, opened the cloſing for a time, whereby the Food taken in, ws ſuffered to paſs, after the uſe of this for a day or two, he was able to ſwallow again, and afterwardsto take his Food well enough: and within a few days, he began to ſpeak, to diſcern any thing, and becoming wonderful hungry, to ask for, all day long, all ſorts of Food, and greedily to devour what ever was brought to him. In the mean time, by reaſon of his long ſickneſs, and the Nervous parts being grievouſly hurt; he was grown ſo Lean, that the Bones ſcarce ſticking to the Skin, he repreſented exactly a living Skeleton. But afterwards, by the ſedulous, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable, and prudent care of the Mother about his diet, he recovered perfect Health, and is yet living, and well.</p>
                     <p>When this child had hardly arived ot the height of his ſickneſs, his Brother, elder about two years, on the Ides of <hi>January,</hi> was taken almoſt after the ſame manner. At firſt he was troubled with a Torpor and heavineſs sof the Head, then growing Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh, with a ſleepineſs and ſtupidity: he began to talk idly in his ſleep, then being awake hardly to come to himſelf: after four or five days, theſe ſymptoms grew more grievous: he was able to underſtand little, nor ſcarce to ſpeak articulately, and not without ſtammering. His Urine was thick, cloudy, without Hypoſtaſis, or ſetling of the Contents: there appeared, as in his Brother, red ſpots, ſmall, like Fea-bites; his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements both of his Belly and Bladder, came away involuntarily. But his Pulſe was yet ſtrong and equal; his Hypochondria were ſtretched out, and inflated with a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor of the Abdomen; about the eighth day, he had a ſmall ſtream of Blood: on the eleventh day of his ſickneſs, he fell into a Diarrhaea, by which, in the ſpace of five hours, he caſt forth ſeven times, bilous, thin, and highly ſtinking ſtuff, from whence there was ſome hope of his amendment; but the next day after, the flux of his Belly ceaſing, pains, and torments cruelly infeſted his Belly, that crying out and moaning night and day, he ſent forth moſt heavy complaints; his Hypochondria and Abdomen were tumid like a Tympany, and mightily diſtended; when he could not receive any thing of eaſe, from no remedies, the moſt exquiſite skill of many Phyſicians being tryed, on the fourteenth day he died Convulſive, in theſe torments.</p>
                     <p>A little after his death, <hi>viz.</hi> on the thirteenth of <hi>February,</hi> his Brother, elder than him, about eleven years old, a youth of great hopes, began to be Feaveriſh; and as the others, with a Torpor and heavineſs of his Head, tho leſs ſtrongly affected; but the heat in the Blood was greater, which was of a more hot temperament, and greater perturbation appeared, that for the firſt ſix days, beſides heat and thirſt, he was troubled with a continual endeavour of excretion, now by ſweat, now by ſtool. His Urine was red and troubled; ſome red ſpots, as in the reſt broke forth; on the ſeventh day he had a bleeding about five Ounces, which ceaſing, a great benumedneſs ſucceeded, that for all that day and the night following, he could ſcarce lift up his Eyes: on the eighth day, a moſt plentiful bleeding followed again at the Noſe, that there was danger, leſt he ſhould have loſt his life, together with his Blood: the Blood ſprang ſo copiouſly from his left no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtril, that being received in a Baſon, it made little Bladders or bubbles by its fall: when he had loſt above two pound of Blood, and being taken with a cold ſweat, began to loſe his ſtrength, remedies were at length adminiſtred, and the Flux was yet hardly ſtopped. The Haemorrhage being ſtayed, the Youth ſlept ſoundly, and all that day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſleepy: yet often awakning, he remained well in his ſenſes and was quick in ſenſe, and underſtanding; and being asked of his health, he ſaid he was pretty well; his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:107016:77"/>Urine, which was before red and troubled, then appeared pale, thin, and with a lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Hypoſtaſis, that the ſick ſeemed, (eſpecial becauſe he wanted thirſt, or immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat) to be perfectly cured and freed from the Feaver: on the following morning, being the ninth day of the Feaver, he remained yet torpid, but being raiſed up, he living chearfully and without intemperance, ſeemed to be in a condition of growing well, but that he began a little to faulter in his peech: in the evening, when it was leſt ſuſpected, the Feaver being again inkindled, on a ſudden he fell into a Lethargy, that he was ſcarce able to be awakned from ſleep, and being pulled, ſcarce to know any body, or to ſpeak plainly: altho ſo great a loſs of Blood had gone before, the Pulſe was yet quick, high, and vehement, alſo his Urine red: after deriving, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing remedies, had been uſed all that Night, this Youth ſeemed to be in a little better condition, ſo that in the morning, he continued a long time from ſleep, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to role about his Eyes hither and thither, and to ſet himſelf up a little; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking, or knowledg of thoſe that were about him: before noon, his Eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhut again, he wholly loſt the uſe of every Animal faculty: he lay for three days, as it were Apoplectick, with an high and vehement Pulſe, with a palpitation of the Heart, and a difficult and painful breathing; his Pulſe at length growing leſſer by degrees, he dyed the thirteenth day of the Feaver.</p>
                     <p>On the fifteenth of <hi>February,</hi> his Siſter, ſomwhat leſſer than he was, began to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of a pain and torments in her Belly, a trembling in her hands, and a painful tenſion or ſtretching out of the Muſcles of her Neck, with a Feaveriſh intemperance, and thirſt: on the laſt day of <hi>February,</hi> ſhe growing plainly into a Feaver, could not keep out of her Bed: moreover ſhe was troubled with a wandring heat, now in her Face, now about her lower parts; alſo ſhe became heavy and ſomnolent, and awaking from ſleep, could not preſently come to her ſelf. On the firſt of <hi>March</hi> ſhe was lightly Purged and with eaſe, with an expreſſion of Rhubarb: her Urine was thick and red; elſo petechial red ſpots, (as in the reſt) were conſpicuous: we gave her after that, for four days, at ſeveral times, to wit, after the interval of every ſix hours ſpace, ten drops of the ſpirit of Harts-Horn, in a Spoonful of Cordial Julep; the aforeſaid ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms afterwards leiſurly remitted, and this ſick child, tho ſlowly, recovered health without a manifeſt through Criſis.</p>
                     <p>About the ſame time her little Brother, younger than any of theſe, fell ſick almoſt after the like manner; who, yet, a looſneſs ariſing Naturally of it ſelf, for many days, voyding Choleric and greeniſh ſtuff, was eaſily cured. Alſo in the ſame Family, many other Domeſtics, and ſome ſtrangers coming to help them, the evil being propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Contagion, fell ſick of the ſame Diſeaſe: who notwithſtanding, at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came well, tho with difficulty, and ſlowly, without any regular Criſis being made.</p>
                     <p>That this Feaver was malignant, plainly appears by the Contagion, Mortality, and appearances of ſpots, and many other ſigns; tho that infecting contagion, whereby it ſpread from one to another, ſhewed it ſelf ſlow, and of leſſer Efficacy; becauſe, between the ſickneſſes of each of them, many days, and oftentimes weeks hapned to be, that the infection of this tho acute Diſeaſe, and the diſſemination on others, was ſcarcely finiſhed in four months ſpace, in the ſame Houſe. The Feaver about the firſt beginning ſeemed gentle and mild, not very terrible as to burning; but the matter being heaped together, from the deflagration of the Blood, became preſently untame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, hard to be exterminated, alſo enemical to the Brain and Nervous ſtock; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in each of them, the beginning of the Diſeaſe, was to be known rather by the torpor and ſomnolency, than the fervor and heat; alſo, the Criſis, tho by ſeveral ways attempted, <hi>viz.</hi> by Sweat, Flux, Bleeding, did not happily ſucceed, but for moſt part, the Blood growing turgid with the critical motion, endeavoured to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the Feaveriſh matter, upon the dwellings of the Animal Spirits; yet it ſelf not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, became not putrified by this means, but that about the ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, both humors (to with the Blood and Nervous Juice) being vitiated, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure mixture together, and grievouſly touched, cauſed the event of the Diſeaſe, to be either deadly, or extream dangerous.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> Of the Meaſles and Small-Pox.</head>
                     <p>IN the next place, we refer the Small-pox and Meaſles to the rank of peſtilential and malignant Feavers, which indeed are mixt Diſtempers, conſiſting at once according, and contrary to our Nature. As to their Original, they have their ſeminary born with us: but as to the effect, they produce preternatural ſymptoms, and (as the Plague it ſelf) poyſonous; ſo that they conſtitute ar it were a certain peculiar kind of Feavers, proper indeed to men, but after another manner, than Porphyrius has aſſigned; for it happens for every man only, and once to be diſtempered with the Small-pox or Meaſles: if perchance any one lives free their whole life, or another more ofen fall into theſe Diſtempers, they are rare and unuſual events of Nature, which leſſen not common obſervation; yea tis fully confirmed, to wit, that all, and only men are obnoxious to the Small-pox and Meaſlles, and are wont to be rid of them at one ſickneſs. Concerning the Small-pox, we will treat of them apart from the Meaſles, what the cauſe of them is, then what ſigns and ſymptoms they have, and laſtly what things belong to the Criſis and Cure.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the Cauſes, we ought to conſider in the firſt place, what is the ſecret leading Cauſe, to wit, which renders only and all mankind, and that once, obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to this Diſeaſe. Secondly, we will inquire concerning the evident Cauſes, <hi>viz.</hi> by what and how many ways, this latent and occult diſpoſition, is wont to be, now ſooner now later, deduced into Act. Thirdly, it ſhall be declared, what is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junct cauſe, to wit, by what motion and alteration of the Blood, the figure of this Diſeaſe is produced.</p>
                     <p n="2">1. As to the firſt, this diſpoſition or Natural prediſpoſition, which inclines human kind to this Diſeaſe, ſeems to be a certain evil or impurity of the Blood, conceived in the Womb, among the firſt Rudiments of Generation; almoſt all Authors, would have this aſcribed to the Menſtruous Blood: which Opinion ſeems not altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable: becauſe in a womans Womb, (otherways than in moſt other living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) there is generated a certain Ferment, which being communicated to the maſs of Blood, affords to it vigour and ſpirit, and then at ſet periods, procures a ſwelling up, and an excretion of the ſuperfluous Blood; but at the time of Conception, when the <hi>Menſtrua</hi> wholly ceaſe, very much of this ferment is beſtowed on the <hi>Faetus</hi> or Child; and its Particles, being Haeterogeneous to all the reſt, as a certain extraneous things, are ocnfuſed with the maſs of Blood and humors; with which being involved and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated one from another, lurk or ly hid a long while; yet afterwards, at ſome time, being moved or ſtirred up, by ſome evident cauſe, they ferment with the Blood, and induce to it an ebullition, and then a Coagulation; from whence very many ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptoms of this Diſeaſe ariſe.</p>
                     <p>Theſe fermentative ſeeds ſomtimes are few and gentle, and ſo involved with other little Bodies, as they do not eaſily appear, and are brought into act; ſomtimes they are more and ſtranger; ſo that on the leaſt occaſion they are ripened into this Diſeaſe; hence indeed ſome are taken ſooner, with the Small-Pox in their tender years: others more ſlowly, and not till full or more ripe age: alſo ſome eaſily receive the contagion, but others converſe often with the ſick without danger. The ſooner that any one hath this Diſeaſe, the more ſecure they are; wherefore children moſt often eſcape, oid men, or ſuch as are of years, are more in danger, <hi>viz.</hi> in children or young people, tranſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is more eaſie, alſo the habit of the Body more firm and healthful. But altho the venomous ſeeds of this Diſeaſe, for the moſt part are wont to be diſperſed or blown away at once, and with one ſickneſs; yet it ſomtimes happens, that a part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>infection being ſtill left, the ſick have fallen into this Diſeaſe twice or thrice.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The evident cauſe which ſtirs up theſe fermentative ſeeds, and moſt often brings them into act, may be ſaid to be threefold, <hi>viz.</hi> The contagion received from ſome place: the diſpoſition of the Air, and the immoderate perturbation of the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors. It is moſt manifeſt by daily experience, that this Diſeaſe doth come upon others, and ſpread abroad by contagion; <hi>viz.</hi> from the infected Body, continually flow <hi>Efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via,</hi>
                        <pb n="140" facs="tcp:107016:78"/>which being received by other Bodies, preſently like poyſon they ferment with the Blood, and ſuſcitate or awaken the lurking or ſleeping ſeeds of the ſame Diſeaſe, Homogeneous with themſelves, and diſpoſe them into the figure or Idea of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: neither is the infection only communicated by contact, but at a diſtance. They who live within the ſame houſe, or neighbouring to the ſick, eaſily receive the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; alſo it is cheriſhed in Cloaths, and diſſipated afar off, and transferred to more remote places. They who are of kin one to another, ſooneſt infect each other: alſo they who are fearful, and extreamly dread this Diſeaſe, more readily fall into it: For by fear, the Particles of the infection are conveyed inwardly from the ſuperficies of the Body. At what time the contagion ſpreads, and that the Small-pox are Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, all other Diſeaſes almoſt degenerate into this. Secondly, a certain peculiar diſpoſition of the Air, notably induces the Small-pox; hence moſt often it becomes Popular, and rages ordinarily through whole Regions, Cities and Villages; hence alſo it more often exiſts in the Spring and Autumn: becauſe at that time eſpecially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe manners of little Bodies, and by that means tumultuating flow about in the Air, which we draw in with the vital Air, and ſo various efferveſcencies of the Blood and Humors, and Ideas of Diſeaſes are raiſed up, Neither doth this Diſeaſe become only more frequent and Epidemical, for theſe Cauſes, but alſo it gets a manifold Nature, that ſomtimes the Small-pox are deadly, and as it were peſtiferous, and ſomtimes they are more mild and benign; to wit, as they have contracted more or leſs of malignity from the Air; hence alſo ſomtimes black and livid Whelks or Puſtils appear, and have much of the Nature of the Plague. Thirdly, ſomtimes, tho the tinder of contagion be abſent, and that no malignant conſtitution of the Air had gone before, yet by reaſon of the Blood and Humors being immoderately diſturbed, the Small-pox do ariſe: ſo I have known ſome to have fallen into this Diſeaſe, from a ſurfeit, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate exerciſe, when none beſides in the whole Country about, hath been ſick of it, to wit, the ſeeds of this evil, lying hid, without any previous infection, being ſtirred up by a too great fervor of the Blood, and being aſſociated, gathering toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, eaſily defile, and infect the whole maſs of the Blood, with their ferment.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 So much for the ſecret leading, and evident cauſes, but as to the conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> which is the formal reaſon of this Diſeaſe, or the manner of its being made, the buſineſs ſeems a little more intricate. It is commonly wont to be compared to Muſt growing hot, or Beer when it Purges in the Vat: For if you put to theſe Liquors, any thing of ferment: as their Particles are Heterogeneous, and of wonderful activity, preſently they diffuſe themſelves through the whole ſubſtance of the Liquor, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agitate the more thick and impure Bodies, againſt which they are daſhed, beat them aſunder, and role about them, until a flowring being made, they drive the ſame from the intimate embrace or company of the Liquor, to the outmoſt ſuperficies. After the like manner the Heterogeneous ſeeds of this Diſeaſe, are thought to ferment the Blood, and then by a certain eruption of Whelks or Puſtles, like the flowring, purifies it. But indeed, if we ſhould more ſtrictly conſider the buſineſs, there will appear here a great difference: becauſe the infection of the Small-pox, is as it were a ferment, but corruptive, and compels the Blood to grow hot, not towards perfection, but depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; for when the Particles of this venomous infection ſtrike againſt the receiving ſubject, they preſently raiſe up little Bodies like to themſelves, and born with us, with which being aſſociated, they paſs through the whole maſs of the Blood, and make it to grow highly turgid, and to boil up, and after ſome time growing fervent, to go into parts, and to be coagulated, <hi>viz.</hi> the diſperſed ſeeds of the Poyſon, diſſolve the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Blood, preſently profligate the more pure Spirits, then they joyn its more thick Particles to themſelves, and by their adheſion, render them as it were congealed: The portions being ſo coagulated, together with the infolded ſeeds of the poyſon, being left by the reſt of the Blood, in its circuit, between the extremities of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, are affixed to the skin: by which means, if Nature being ſtrong enough, doth caſt forth the whole poyſon, with the congealed Blood, the remaining maſs of the Blood, altho made poorer, remains however in a condition to continue life and health: but if the Blood, being too exceſſively congealed, cannot be purified after this manner; or if portions of the Blood growing together with the poyſon, do not fully break forth, or at laſt do ſtagnate within, they wholly corrupt the Liquor of the Blood, or elſe being affixed to the Viſcera, and eſpecially to the Heart, they deſtroy their conſtitution and ſtrength.</p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="tcp:107016:78"/>
                     <p>Portions of the congealed Blood, with the poyſon, begin to break forth about the fourth day, (now ſooner now later:) becauſe coagulation is not preſently induced, but after ſome time, in which the venom unfolds it ſelf, and ferments the Blood with its effervency: Firſt, light portions of the infected Blood, and thoſe but few in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, like to Flea-bites, are fixed in the skin: quickly after more appear, and thoſe firſt broke forth, by the acceſſion of new matter, and by the continual appulſion of the congealed Blood, increaſe and are elevated into a tumor: then theſe whelks at firſt red being by degrees increaſed, at length grow white, <hi>viz.</hi> the Blood being thruſt forth of the Veſſels with the poyſon, by reaſon of the heat and ſtagnation, is changed into matter: about the ſeventh day after the eruption, the white tumors grow cruſty, into a dry ſcab; for the more thin part of the matter being evaporated, the reſt grows hard, which then having eaten, and broke off the Cuticula, or outward thin skin, falls away from the fleſh or next skin.</p>
                     <p>When the infection of the Small-pox, is at once impreſſed on the Blood and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, it very rarely can be blotted out, or diſſipated by Medicines, or blood letting; but that its hidden diſpoſition, will break forth into act; wherefore at firſt it diffuſes it ſelf by little and little, and inſpires the maſs of Blood, as it were with a ferment, hence an ebullition and growing hot are produced in the whole Body, the Veſſels are diſtended, the Viſcera provoked, the membranes pulled, until the ſeeds of he conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, by fuſing and coagulating the Blood, being at length involved with its congealed portions, are thruſt forth of doors. The eſſence of this Diſeaſe will be better laid open, if that I ſhall recount the ſigns and ſymptoms, which are to be obſerved in its whole courſe, and ſhall add in order the reaſons and cauſes of them, on which they depend: but they are thoſe which either indicate the Diſeaſe being preſent, or tht foretel its ſtate and event.</p>
                     <p>As to the Diagnoſis of this Diſeaſe, by which it may be known, whether any one at firſt falling ſick, will have the Small-pox or not; at that time are to be conſidered, the force of the contagion, and the concourſe of the ſymptoms firſt appearing; for if by reaſon of the evil conſtitution of the Air, this Diſeaſe doth ſpread abroad every where, none then is taken with a Feaver, without the ſuſpition of the Small-pox, eſpecially if they never had them before in their lives; but if this Diſeaſe be more rare, and without fear of contagion, yet its unlooked for aſſault quickly betrays it ſelf, by theſe ſort of ſigns and ſymptoms.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. There is a wand ring and uncertain Feaver, ſomtimes ſtrong, ſomtimes more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, obſerving no reaſon of increaſe, or growing continually hot, ſo that the ſick are now highly hot, by and by without any evident cauſe, they are without a Feaver; the cauſe of which is, for that the fermentative ſeeds are not agitated by an equal motion, but like fire half choaked, now increaſes more, and now are almoſt quelled, and ready to expire, until the burning ſpreading more largly, the flame every where breaks forth.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. A pain in the Head, and Loins, is ſo peculiar a ſign in this Diſeaſe, that it almoſt alone, in a continual Feaver, ſignifies the approach of the ſmall-pox: the reaſon of which is commonly imputed, to the greater Veſſels being very much diſtended, by the effervency of the Blood: but indeed it appears not, wherefore the ſame trouble is not cauſed equally in other parts, by reaſon of the like diſtention of the Veſſels, and wherefore in the ſmall-pox, more than in a burning Feaver, or in other Feavers, where the Blood grows more hot, theſe kind of pains ſhould increaſe; yea, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that great pains, now in the Head, now in the Loins, do urge, when the Blood but little ſwelling up, the Veſſels are not amplified, <hi>viz,</hi> in the beginning of the Diſeaſe, when the Feaveriſh diſteper is not yet conſpicuous, whilſt the ſick as yet goe abroad, and are well in their ſtomach, upon the firſt coming on of the ſmall-pox, they betray themſelves by theſe kind of pains. Wherefore, the cauſe of theſe kind of dolorific pains, ſeems rather to ſubſiſt in the nervous ſtock, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Brain, and ſpinal marrow, and that by reaſon of the membranes, and nervous parts being pulled or hauled, by the particles of the Poyſon, theſe pains do ariſe. For it is moſt likely, that the innate ſeeds of the ſmall-pox, are chiefly hidden in the Spermatick parts, and that firſt of all, the Contagion lays hold on, for the moſt part, the animal Spirits; hence, the firſt effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency is ſtirred up in the juice, wherewith the Brain, and nervous parts, but eſpecially the Spinal marrow are watered, and from thence the evil is Communicated to the maſs of Blood; wherefore, this Diſeaſe beginning, the Head and Loins are tormented with cruel pain; afterwards, the venom being tranſlated into the Blood, the Feaveriſh effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency is ſtirred up in the whole.</p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="tcp:107016:79"/>
                     <p n="3">3. Great anxiety, and unquietneſs, and ſomtimes a ſwooning, infeſt the ſick, <hi>viz.</hi> by reaſon of the perturbed motion of the Blood, as alſo its equal mixture, beginning to be ſolved, by the Poyſonous ferment, the Blood from thence being apt to ſtagnate in the Heart, and to be hindred in its Circuit, cauſes theſe affections to be thus excited.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Cruel Vomiting, alſo when the Ventricle is free from an impure ballaſt of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, very often accompanies this Diſeaſe; the reaſon of which is, becauſe the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative ſeeds, being ſtirred up into motion, by the little Arteries gaping into the Coates of the Ventricle, are depoſed by every appulſe of the Blood, and raiſe up Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, as if the particles of ſtibium had been ſwallowed; but afterwards, afloon as ſweating being procured, the Poyſon is driven forth outwardly, this Symptom ceaſes, and the ſick are well in their ſtomach, without any purging forth of the noxious matter.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. With theſe may be ranked, the Symptoms which ſhew themſelves, according to the various habitudes of the Body, after a diverſe manner, as heavy ſleepineſs, terrors in ſleep, deliriums, tremblings, and convulſions, ſneezing, heat, redneſs, a ſenſe of prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the whole Body, involuntary tears, a ſparkling and itching of the eyes, a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor or ſwelling up of the face, a vehemency of Symptoms from the beginning, that the Diſeaſe ſeems preſently to have attained its ſtrength: the reaſon of all which, may eaſily be elucidated, if what hath been already ſaid, concerning the Symptoms of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, be obſerved; with reſpect to the diverſe tempers of the ſick, their habit, and age, as alſo the condition of the year.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. As to the Prognoſis of this Diſeaſe, by the Symtomatick ſigns, it is indicated to be either ſalutary, or mortal, or of a doubtful Event.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The buſineſs promiſes well, when this Diſeaſe has benign circumſtances; to wit, when it happens in a good conſtitution of the Air and Year, at what time the ſmall-pox are leſs malignant and peſtilential; as in the year 1654, at <hi>Oxford,</hi> about Autumn, the ſmall-pox ſpread abundantly, yet very many eſcaped with them: but before, in the year 1649. this Diſeaſe was more rare, yet moſt dyed of it. Alſo, thee is leſs danger, if it ſhould happen in the age of Children, or Infancy, or in a ſanguine temper, and good habit of Body, or in a Family, to whoſe Anceſtors, the ſmall-pox have not proved mortal: Beſides, if in the whole courſe of the Diſeaſe, the Symptoms prove laudable, if in the firſt aſſault, there be a gentle Feaver, without cruel Vomiting, Swooning, Delirium, or other horrid Diſtempers; if the Feaver about the fourth day be allayed, with the Symptoms chiefly urging, and then ſome little red ſpots begin to appear: if on the ſecond day, of the coming forth of thoſe little red ſpots, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more conſpicuous, which afterwards grow together by degrees into little Pim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and are ripened into matter; if about the tenth day, or thereabouts, after the eruption, the white tumors begin to ſcab, and by little and little from thence to fall off: if after their firſt coming forth, the ſmall-pox are ſoft, diſtinct, few, round, ſharp pointed, lying only towards the skin, and not in the inward parts, you may be confident the ſick will do very well, and is in a good condition.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The appearances, which in the ſmall-pox, ſignifie the buſineſs to be ſuſpected, and full of danger are of this ſort: if there be a maligant conſtitution of the Air that this Diſeaſe becomes Peſtilential, and that many die of it: if men of more ripe years, or middle age, be taken with it; if it happens in a cold and melancholick tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or in an impure or evil humoured Body, where the Blood is not rightly circulated, nor tranſpiration truly performed; or if the Hypochondria, or Precordia are obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, ſome of the Viſcera infirm, or troubled with an Ulcer, or if the habit of the Body be too fat, the ſmall-pox happen not without great danger of life; nor is it leſs to be feared, when preſently after the beginning, a great Feaver, cruel Vomiting, Swooning, a dejection of ſtrength, Phrenſie or Delirium, come upon them, and that theſe deſiſt not, upon the full coming forth of the ſmall-pox, for theſe ſignifie a too great perturbation in the Blood and humours; alſo, a confuſion and contumacy of the morbifick matter, which can neither be ſubdued, nor eaſily ſeparated from the maſs of Blood, or equally extruded from it: if there be an anxiety, and great unqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs, with an inordinate boyling up, and growing hot of the Blood; alſo a great thirſt, a difficulty of breathing, alſo a flux of the Belly, or Dyſentery, they ſhew that ſweating is hindred, and that the malignant humours, reſtagnate towards the inward parts: The ſmall-pox breaking forth ſlowly, argue the crudity, and untameableneſs of the matter, and the impotency of Nature, and tis much more a ſign, if they come forth double, and continued, in too exceſſive a quantity, and confuſion, and alſo if
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:107016:79"/>there be a diſordered expulſion, and irregular, of that matter, when not in certain iſſues, but every where undiſtinguiſhable. The pox being hard, ſignifie the incoction of the ſame matter, being depreſſed, a weak expulſion; and they are the worſe, if in the midſt of them appear black ſpots; or if purple ſpots familiar to the Feaver, or the Plague, are ſprinkled among the pox, they indicate a great malignity, and putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Blood, ſuch as is wont to be found in the Peſtilence. Laſtly, the pox being black, livid, or green, are of an evil omen, becauſe, beſides the coagulations of the Blood, they argue its deadlineſſes, and corruptions, as in a Gangreen, or peſtilent Plague ſore; if when the ſmall-pox being come forth, they preſently grow dry, and the ſwelling of the parts remit, it ſhews a going back of the malignant matter, or of the congealed Blood, with the Poyſon, and a reſtagnation of it to the inward parts; from whence, unleſs a more free Diaphoreſis or ſweating be excited, that it may be thruſt forth of doors again, death for the moſt part quickly follows: For from hence, the Blood being more coagulated, enters into putrefaction, alſo it is apt to be hindred in its motion, and to ſtagnate in the heart, and Veſſels. If after the coming forth of the ſmall-pox, a flux of the Belly, or a Bleeding at noſe, comes upon them, it is an evil ſign, becauſe, by this means, the Venom driven outwardly, is again called back inwardly; but ſomtimes I have obſerved theſe Symptoms to have hapned, with great eaſe to the ſick, <hi>viz.</hi> Nature being before oppreſſed, and burthened; after this manner, part of the burthen being as it were detracted, ſhe was eaſed; wherefore, ſhe buckled her ſelf to the work of ſweating, and more readily expedited the expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the noxious matter.</p>
                     <p>As to the Curative part, ſince the ſtadium or courſe of this Diſeaſe, hath three ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as it were ſo many meaſures, diſtinct one from another, the Curative intentions ought to be accommodated to each of theſe; wherefore the Curative method con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſmall-pox, teacheth firſt, what is to be done ſo long as the Blood boyles up, and grows hot inwardly, with the motion of the fermentative matter, and before the ſmall-pox appear, which period for the moſt part is finiſhed, in four or five days.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, what means or manner of Dyet and Phyſick is to be inſtituted, after the coming forth of the ſmall-pox, until the ſtate or ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the whelks or pox come to the height, and being fully ſuppurated or ripened, begin to dry. Thirdly and laſtly, what we muſt obſerve in the declining of the Diſeaſe, even whilſt the ſmall-pox growing dry, fall off.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. As to the firſt, let the intention be, that we may carry away every impediment of Nature, whereby the Blood being infected by the ferment of the Small-pox, and apt to be coagulated, may yet retain an equal motion in the Heart, and without ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Veſſels, and growing hot, may expel forth of doors the congealed por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the Poyſon; in the mean time, there muſt be a caution, leaſt the work of fermentation or growing hot be any ways hindred, or too much provoked; for by this, the maſs of the Blood is agitated into congealed portions, more than it ought to be; by that other, it is reſtrained too much, in it motion, nor are the invenomed Particles ſent forth of doors, with the congealed Blood; Nature in the work of ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and expulſion, is wont to be hindred, by too great an heap of excrements in the Viſcera, or by the abundance of Blood in the Veſſels; wherefore, upon the firſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of the Diſeaſe, care muſt be taken, that if need be, an evacuation by Vomit or Stool, be timely procured; but only more mild Purges, and gentle, are to be uſed, which do not too much provoke, or diſturb the Humors: wherefore, at this time, Purges, Emetics, or Clyſters, now theſe, now thoſe, take place; alſo the letting of Blood, if there be a fulneſs, is performed with good ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>During this growing hot of the Blood, dyet ought to be inſtituted ſlender and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately cooling, <hi>viz.</hi> Barly-Broth, or Grewel of Oatmeal, Poſſet-drink, Small Beer or the like: Fleſh, and Fleſh Broths are to be avoided, whereby the Blood, by reaſon of the too great plenty of Sulphureous Food, may be inkindled more than it ought; alſo all cold, and ſharp or acid things are hurtful: for theſe congeal and Blood more, and contract the little mouths of the Veſſels, by their aſtriction or binding Nature, that the Small-pox come forth leſs freely; alſo hot things, and Cordials are cautiouſly to be adminiſtred, for by theſe the Blood and Humors are too much agitated, and driven into confuſion.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Small-pox begin to appear, there are three things, which by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Rule we preſcribe to be performed, to every ſick perſon; to wit, that a ſoft and gentle Sweat be ſtill continued in the Blood; alſo, that the Throat and Eyes may be preſerved, from a too great eruption of the Small-pox. That the Blood lightly grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hot may emit the Small-pox, decoctions of Figs, Marigold flowers, and ſhavings
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:107016:80"/>of Harts-Horn in Poſſet-drink, are commonly preſcribed, and the uſe of them is general for a long time, almoſt with all people; for the ſame intention, we are wont ſomtimes in a day, to give them moderate Cordials; but the more hot and ſtrong are carefully to be ſhunned. Purging and Blood letting here are moſt wickedly enterpriſed, and theſe, tho neceſſity compelled, Phyſicians dare not meddle with for fear of blame: For to defend the Throat and Gutteral parts, we put on the outer skin, a defence of Saffron dipped in Breaſt Milk, and ſowed in a Rag; for theſe, by opening the pores, draw away the venom outwardly, from the moſt inward part of the Throat; alſo for this end, we adminiſter Gargariſms, and things to waſh the mouth, which by their reſtriction, reſtrain the coming forth of the Small-pox withing: we defend the Eyess, with peculiar Medicines, of Roſe-water, and Breaſt Milk, with Saffron, and ſuch like, frequently iterated, from the incurſion of the Small-pox: Beſides theſe, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times certain moſt horrid ſymptoms do trouble, which muſt be timely helped with convenient Remedies; ſomtimes there are preſent, Watchings, Phrenſie, Bleeding at Noſe, Vomiting, Looſneſs, and a falling back of the Small-pox: for theſe and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others, as occaſion ariſes, a prudent Phyſician knows how to provide; in which however there is need of great caution, leaſt whilſt we take care fo the ſmaller mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the great work of Nature ſhold be diſturbed by a too great moleſtation of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. For in all this time there is one, and a continued Criſis: wherefore nothing is to be meddled with raſhly. There is required the moſt care and circumſpection of the Phyſician and Nurſes, or thoſe that adminiſter to the ſick, when this Diſeaſe is at its height or ſtanding, <hi>viz.</hi> leaſt that when the Small-pox. be fully come forth, and brought to their greateſt height, tranſpiration ſhould be hindered; for then the ſick are in danger of renewing the Feaver, and of the reſtagnation of the Malignant matter within, whilſt we ſtudy to prevent the one, we for the moſt part bring on the other.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. When the Diſeaſe ſhall be in its declination, and the Small-pox begin to wither and Scab, the buſineſs for the moſt part is out of danger, nor is there much need of a Phyſician: let the ſick, tho he grow very hungry, content himſelf ſtill with a ſlender dyet, and without fleſh: if the Scabs fall off ſlowly, we are wont to ripen them with Lineaments, and peculiar Medicines, to make them fall, and care ſhould be taken that they leave not behind them too great pits: after the ſick having the Sacbs every where fallen off, and are able to riſe and walk about the Chamber, the filthy Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentitious matter in the Bowels, is to be carried away, by two or three times Purging, and then they may be permitted to uſe a more plentiful and ſtronger dyet.</p>
                     <p>The Meaſles are ſo much akin to the Small-pox, that with moſt Authors, they have not deſerved to be handled apart from them, but that either diſtemper have been treated of together, after the like manner and method. The eſſence and cure differ at leaſt accidentally, or as they are greater or leſſer; becauſe in the Meaſles the whealks riſe not up to ſo great a bulk, neither are they ſuppuritated; wherefore the ſickneſs is ſooner ended and with leſs danger. This diſtemper is wont moſtly to ſpread upon children, more rarely among thoſe of years, or old men, alſo thoſe who firſt have had the Small-pox, are not afterwards ſo obnoxious to the Meaſles, but in moſt things, either diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per are of kin, <hi>viz.</hi> the evil being contracted in the Womb, diſpoſes men only, and all men once, to the Meaſles; the malignant conſtitution of the Air, and ſomtimes a ſurfeit, and moſt often the contagion, are wont to bring the hidden diſpoſition into act: there are preſent marks of malignity, and the ſickneſs oftentimes becomes Epidemical, and with mortality and contagion.</p>
                     <p>That I may briefly contract the ſum of the matter: it ſeems that the Meaſles are a certain lighter flowring, of on extraneous ferment, contracted from the Womb; by which, ſome Particles being ſtirred up into motion, make the Blood lightly to grow hot, and to be a little coagulated: wherefore the marks from thence ſpread abroad, are diſſipated without any breaking of the Cuticula, or outward skin, by evaporation only: but the Small-pox are a more full and ſtrong agitation, according to all the Particles of the ſame ferment, which cauſing a greater ebullition and coagulation of the Blood, produces far more full whelks, and greater in bulk, and not to be diſſolved, but by ſuppuration, or growing into matter: when the Small-pox preceed, they are not only exempt from the ſame diſeaſe any more, but alſo from the Meaſles, becauſe they conſume only ſome of the Particles of the ferment, leave ſtill a diſpoſition to the Small-pox; wherefore old men, or thoſe of years, are not ſo readily infected with the Meaſles, becauſe they are either freed from the contagion, by having before had the Small-pox, or elſe the infection of this more light Diſeaſe, is eaſily reſiſted by their more ſtrong Spirits.</p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:107016:80"/>
                     <p>It were eaſie to illuſtrate the afore-recited Doctrine, concerning the Small Pox, with Hiſtories and Obſervations fo the ſick, becauſe there is no Diſeaſe beſides can ſupply with a greater plenty of Examples, or variety of Accidents: but of the great number of this kind, I ſhall only propoſe in this place a few Caſes, and thoſe remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for ſome irregularities.</p>
                     <p>It is a uſual thing to handle all that are ſick of the Small Pox, with a like, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame method of Curing, and manner of Dyet; wherefore, a Phyſician is rarely ſent for to the common ſort, but the buſineſs is wholly committed to ſome women, profeſſing themſelves skilful in this Diſeaſe: and theſe are wont to boyl in their broths, and all the ſuppings of the ſick, Marigold Flowers, ſhaving of Harts-horn, and ſometimes Figs; alſo every night to adminiſter a Bolus of Diaſcordium: and they who grow not well by this kind of Government, tho not neglected, yet are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be incurable, by reaſon of the cruelty of the Diſeaſe. But truly this kind of practice is not convenient for all alike, nor to be adminiſtred to every one indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, as theſe two following Hiſtories will make manifeſt.</p>
                     <p>A Young Man, about 20 years of Age, of a ſlender body, and more hot tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, began to be feaveriſh in the beginning of the Spring, at firſt cruel Vomitings, an oppreſſion of the heart, and frequent changes of heat and ſhivering, a pain in his Loyns, a diſturbance of his ſancy and wakings infeſted him: on the third day, the Small Pox appearing, thoſe ſymptoms remitted, but ſtill the Feaver, with heat and thirſt continued. Not only the accuſtomed Decoctions in this Diſeaſe, but alſo a moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Julep, of a moſt grateful taſte, were ſo nauſeous and troubleſome to him, that he would not ſo much as taſte the ſame, but with a great deal of trouble: as often as he took going to ſleep, Diaſcordium, or any other more temperate Cordial, for the continuing his ſweat, tho in a very little quantity, the night following he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſleep, and in great diſquiet; and then in the beginning of the morning a bleeding followed, by which means, indeed, the Small Pox being full come forth, the Life of the ſick was in great danger, by reaſon of this occaſion happening once or twice; wherefore, when I had found by obſervation, his blood apt to grow immoderately hot, by ſo light a provocation, I inſtituted this method as occaſion ſerved. All Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines being let alone, he took for the quenching his thirſt ſmall beer, and ſimple Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Drink, at his pleaſure: for his food, becauſe he vomited back all Oatmeal Grewel, or Barly Broth, he eat only apples roaſted tender, and dreſt with ſuggar and roſe water, often in a day. Nature being contented with this ſlender ordering, and being ſeen to be diſturbed with any other thing, performed happily its work, that the ſick perſon grew well, without any grievous ſymptom afterwards, the Small Pox from thence ripening, and then of their own accord falling off.</p>
                     <p>In the middle of the Autumn, of the former Years, a Gentile Young Man, being indued with a ſharp Blood, and obnoxious to a frequent bleeding at Noſe, fell ſick of the Small Pox; his Blood of its own accord grew immoderately hot, that the whealks very quickly broke forth over all his Body: Poſſet Drink, with Marigold Flowers, and other uſual things boyled in it, alſo Juleps, or any Cordials, tho tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and gently provoking ſweat, moſt certainly ſtirr'd up a Flux of Blood in this Perſon; wherefore I ordered the like manner of Dyet, as in the ſick Perſon before cited, by which he found himſelf better, however, in the very ſtate or ſtanding of the Diſeaſe, (when the Small Pox being fully come forth, by reaſon of a more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult tranſpiration, the Feaver is wont to be ſomewhat renewed in all) this ſick Man fell into a moſt plentiful bleeding; that after a large profuſion of Blood, the Small Pox began to flagg or fall: After that Remedies, very many, were tryed in vain, for the ſtaying of the Blood, at length a little Bag being hung about his Neck (in which was a Toad dryed in the Sun, and bruiſed) he firſt, and immediately perceived eaſe; tho the bleeding was by this means ſtayed, and not any more returning, (whilſt he conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wore this peculiar Medicine in his Boſom) our ſick Man ſtill uſing a moſt thin and cooling Dyet, grew quite well; that indeed from hence it may appear, that altho the Blood in this Diſſemper, is apt to be greatly coagulated, yet ſo long as the Vital Spirits, being ſtrong and robuſt, are able ſufficiently to execute their government, they indeavouring by their proper ſtrength or forces, do beſt of all ſeparate and thruſt forth the congealed portions of the Blood, as it were by a certain skilful ſeparation; and this work is moſt of all hindred, when the ſame ſpirits are too much irritated by Cordials, or more hot food, and agitated into confuſion: But in the Plague it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens otherwiſe, becauſe in this, if any delay be granted, the Spirits themſelves are
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:107016:81"/>preſently profligated by the venom; wherefore, here they muſt fight cloſe and quick, when in the Small Pox, the Phyſician does his buſineſs better by delay.</p>
                     <p>Concerning letting of Blood, at the inſtant breaking out of the Small Pox, it is very dubious: formerly, among our Contrimen, this was eſteemed a wicked buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, neither were they wont to admit of Phlebotomy under any pretext of neceſſity: but of late, experience having taught us, in ſome caſes, it is found, that to let Blood hath been wholly profitable and neceſſary; which evacuation however, if it ſhould be adminiſtred indifferently in every conſtitution, or when this need ſhould be, it ſhould be performed in too large a quantity, by that means oftentimes very great da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage ariſes.</p>
                     <p>Some years before, I viſited a young Gentlewoman, of a florid countenance, and more hot temperature, growing into a Feaver, after the fourth month of her being with Child: ſhe was troubled with a cruel vomiting, a moſt cruel pain of the Loyns, beſides with moſt ſtrong heat and thirſt: her pulſe was ſwift, with a ſtrong and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement vibration or beating; altho the Small Pox had never been in that place, yet theſe ſymptoms gave no light ſuſpicion of this Diſeaſe; however, its great efferveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency indicated that Blood ſhould be taken away; wherefore I took away a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix ounces preſently, upon which the heat remitted ſomwhat, yet the vomiting, with a cruel pain in the Loyns, remained ſtill: At the hour of ſleep I gave her a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Bolus, with half a grain of our Laudanum, by which means quiet ſleep follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a pleaſant ſweat, and an allaying of all the ſymptoms: the next morning the Small Pox came forth, with which, altho the ſick Gentlewoman was greatly diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered, yet ſhe grew well without any dangerous ſickneſs, or fear of miſcarrying, and went out her full time.</p>
                     <p>The laſt Autumn, a ſtrong Man, of an active and robuſt conſtitution of body, yet of a pale countenance, and more cold temper, fell into a Feaver: on the ſecond day he was tormented with heat and thirſt, and a moſt cruel pain in his Loyns: when I had preſcribed Blood to be taken in a ſmall quantity, the unskilful Chirurgion, who was ſent for, took from him almoſt half a pound; a little after, the ſick man began to be all over in a cold ſweat, on a ſudden to looſe all ſtrength, to be troubled with a ſhivering, a weak Pulſe and unequal, and frequent ſwooning: At this time being ſent for, I gave him a temperate Cordial, to be taken frequently. His Spirits and Pulſe being thereby reſtored, the Feaver was renewed, which afterwards, for ſome days, yea, weeks, exerciſed the ſick man, after a very irregular manner; for he was wont for three or four days, to grow very hot, alſo to be infeſted with thirſt, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, headach, and other ſymptoms, then to be troubled all over with a copious and critical ſweat, by which indeed for half a days ſpace he found himſelf better: But from thence; the Feaver ſtill growing worſe, heaped together again new matter, till it was diſperſed by another Criſis, and then another. After that he had been thus feaveriſh, for at leaſt twenty days irregularly, at length the Small Pox began to come forth, in ſeveral parts of his Body, here and there, and then the Feaver wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; yet within few days, by reaſon of ſome errors committed in his Dyet, very many of the whealks began to fall down again, few of them only being brought to maturity: However, inſtead of the ſubſiding Small Pocks, a mighty Bubo grew up behind his right Ear; from which, being ſoon ripened, and broke, a great plenty of matter flowed forth for many days, and ſo at length the corruptions of the Blood, unable otherways to be diſſipated, were carried forth by degrees, and the ſick Perſon recovered perfect Health.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> Of Feavers of Child-bearing Women.</head>
                     <p>VUlgar Experience abundantly teſtifies, that the Feavers of Women lying in are very dangerous, beyond the diſpoſition of other common Feavers: alſo that the ſame differ very much, as to their eſſence, from both a ſimple and putrid Synochus, plainly appears from their ſigns and ſymptoms rightly weigh'd: wherefore, I believe it not to be from the matter, to handle after malignant Feavers, the acute Diſeaſes of Women lying in being exceeding neer of kin to thoſe, for their mortality or perniciouſneſs. Yet, before I ſhall enter upon the unſolding theſe Diſeaſes, it behoves us to conſider their ſubjects, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bodies of Women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, after what manner they are prediſpoſed, and by what proviſion they are made obnoxious to theſe kind of ſickneſſes.</p>
                     <p>Concerning this, the firſt thing that offers itſelf, is, that the Flux of the menſtruous Blood, is wholly convenient to be ſuffered by human kind, and at this time for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, concerning whoſe nature and original we ſhall not inquire in this place; but it ſhall ſuffice to note, that in them, the particles of the Blood, to be periodically thruſt forth, are very Fermentative; which, if reteined in the Body, beyond the wonted manner of Nature, are very often the cauſe of many Diſeaſes: unleſs only when a Woman conceives with Child. For all the time of her being big Bellied, the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Flowers are ſtopped without any incommodiouſneſs; and in the mean time, milk, or the alible juice, is diſpoſed in great plenty, about the parts of the Womb, for the nouriſhment of the Child: but after the Birth, this daily ſuppreſſion of the monthly Flowers, is recompenſed by a copious flowing forth of the Lochia, or what comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way after the Birth; and the milk within three days having wholly left the Womb, ſprings forth plentifully into the Breaſts: at which time, Women lying in, are wont to be troubled with a ſmall Feaver. If that the milk be driven away from the Breaſts, it reſtagnates again towards the Womb, and is thruſt forth, together with the Lochia, under the form of a whitiſh humour. In the mean time, the Womb, after the Birth, becomes ſubject to various diſtempers; for oftentimes, its tone is hurt, the unity is diſſolved, and many other accidents are induced, which render Women lying in ſubject to danger: wherefore, that their acute Diſeaſes may be rightly unfolded, it is convenient, for to conſider chiefly theſe three things, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, the nouriſhment of the Child, or the Generation of Milk, both in the Womb, and in the Dugs, and the metaſtaſis or tranſlation of it from one to another. Secondly, the purging of the Mothers Blood, or the profluvium of the Lochia, after a long ſuppreſſion of the Menſtrua. Thirdly, the condition of the Womb after the Birth, and its influence on other parts of the Body. And theſe being premiſed, we will ſpeak of the Feavers of Women lying in, <hi>viz.</hi> both the milkie, and the putrid, called, and that deſervedly, malignant, by reaſon of its deadlineſs.</p>
                     <p>Firſt the Milk, and nouriſhing humour, being heaped up in the parts of the Womb, for the nouriſhment of the Child, are of a like nature, tho ſomewhat different in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency. Milk is indeed more thick, becauſe it ought to be received in at the mouth, and to be kept in the Ventricle, and afterwards it more thin portion to be conveyed to the maſs of Blood. The other alible Juice is more thin, and like the water of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled Milk, becauſe 'tis immediately poured into the Blood of the Embryo, thorow the umbilick Veſſels, without any previous digeſtion. Either Juice is ſuppoſed to come from the Chyle freſh made in the mothers ſtomach; what is repoſed, or laid up in the Breaſt, is more thick and white, by reaſon of the more thin or open ſtrainer, and coction in the greater Glanduals; on the contrary, it happens in the Womb o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, where the Glandulas are ſmaller, and the Straining more cloſe. But there in a great diſagreement among Authors, concerning the paſſages, by which this hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor is carried, both in the Breaſts, and into the Cake of the Womb. Some contend, that Milk only is begotten of the Blood, more plentifully cocted in the Glandulas, which yet, by reaſon of the immenſe diſpenſe of Milk, which conſiſts not with the Blood, this ſeems not probable. Others affirm, that the Chyle, or Milkie humor,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:107016:82"/>is immediately conveyed from the Viſcera of Concoction, thorow occult paſſages, without any alteration, into either receptacles. But in the mean time, while theſe paſſages lie open, it ſeems indeed to me more likely, that from the meat taken into the Mothers Stomach, a portion of the Chyle thence made, is preſently ſupped up into the Veins, which having obtained the vehicle of the Blood before it be aſſimilated by it, is laid up in the Glandulas, deſtinated here and there for the receiving of it, being carried by the Arteries, and laſtly ſeparated from the maſs of Blood; for as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that drink being plentifully taken, preſently paſſes thorow the whole maſs of Blood, and is rendered by Urine like water: and as old Ulcers, by means of the Blood coming between, prey upon the nutritious humor, from the whole Body, and pour it forth under the ſhape of a putrified matter, Why may not the alible Juice in like manner, being ſtrained by the Collander of the Glandulas, before it has indued the colour of Blood, go into a Milkie humour? This indeed ſeems more probable, becauſe, whilſt the Milk is carried from the Womb into the Breaſts, and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, paſſing thorow the maſs of Blood, it is wont to ſtir up a perturbation thorow the whole, with a feaveriſh intemperance; beſides, in the firſt days, after the Birth, when the Glandulas do leſs rightly perform the office of ſecretion: Beaſts, who have not the Lochia, give a bloody Milk, which is drawn forth of their Udders, that is, mixt with Blood, by reaſon of the plenty of it flowing forth together.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, As to what belongs to the Menſtrua being ſuppreſſed, in the time of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Child, and the Lochia plentifully' coming away, after being Delivered, we ſay that after the Conception of the Child, the Menſtrua ought to be ſuppreſſed by Divine Deſignation, for that the flowing of them often cauſes abortion; then, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Veſſels are filled by a continual ſtilling forth of the alible juice into the parts of the Womb, the maſs of the Blood doth not ariſe into ſwellings up, to be allayed by the menſtruous Flux. For the ſame reaſon, Women for the moſt part, have not their courſes ſo long as they give ſuck. Perhaps in ſome, indued with a more hot Blood, the monthly courſes flow, both whilſt they are Big-bellied, and in the time of their giving ſuck, but that more rarely, and is wont not to happen without trouble; yet in the mean time, the Menſtrua being ſuppreſſed, during the time of being with Child, becauſe much leſs of the nutritious humor is expended at tha ttime for Milk, they much more deprave the Blood, than the ſame being reſtrained at the time of ſuckling the Child, are wont to do: yea, from them being long ſuppreſſed, in the former condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an, as it were, envenomed taint is impreſſed on the maſs of Blood, which, unleſs it be purged forth by the daily Flux of the Lochia, preſently after being brought to Bed, produces grievous, and almoſt malignant Diſtempers. Wherefore, that I may give my opinion of the flowing of the Lochia, I ſay, that this bleeding proceeds immediately from the Veſſels being broken, by which the after-Birth did ſtick to the Womb, and that by this way, the excrementitious Blood and humors, being partly heaped up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Womb during the time of being with Child, and partly flowing from the whole maſs of the Blood, are evacuated, <hi>viz.</hi> whilſt the Womb at firſt intumified in its bulk, falls down preſently after the Birth, and is contracted into a leſſer ſpace, the Blood is plentifully preſſed forth, from the Veſſeis opening into it. But beſides, foraſmuch as during the ſuppreſſion of the courſes, the bloody maſs is imbued with very fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Particles, as ſoon as after the Birth, the mouths of the Veſſels are opened, forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as it were at the inſtant of a more large Flux of monthly courſes, the whole Blood grows hot (even as Muſt of new Wine upon the opening the Bottle) and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to purge forth the highly fermentative particles, out of its boſom, by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the Lochia, as it were the flowring: And therefore, beſides the Blood, which in the firſt days, oftentimes flows pure, by reaſon of the freſh opening of the Veſſels, afterwards is ſiſted forth matter very much diſcloured, <hi>viz.</hi> livid and green, and this very ſtinking, This kind of Flux is wont to continue, at leaſt for 14 days, yea, in ſome for a month; and if that by reaſon of any error, it be ſtopped before the maſs of Blood be throughly purified, by ſuch flowring, preſently a Feaver, very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, with horrid proviſions of ſymptoms, is wont to be induced: of which we ſhall ſpeak anon in its proper place.</p>
                     <p>The third conſideration, previous to the Doctrine of Feavers, belonging to Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in child-bed, is chiefly about the Womb it ſelf; to wit, how it is affected after Child-bearing, and what influence it has on other parts of the Body. As to the firſt, there are chiefly two accidents, upon which the acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed very much depend, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, The falling down of the Womb, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:107016:82"/>of it, from the bulk of ingravidation, to its natural ſite and magnitude: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the ſolution of the unity, within its cavity, by reaſon of the breaking of the connexion, or tying to the cake of it, or after-Birth. When the Child; with what wraps it about, is put forth, preſently the ſides of the Womb it ſelf, before very much amplified or enlarged, do mutually cloſe, and by the help of the Fibres, leiſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract themſelves into a narrower ſpace; by reaſon of this kind of contraction, the Blood and Corruptions, or matter, are plentitully preſſed forth, from the Veſſels and Pores of the Womb, and are thruſt forth with the Lochia. But ſometimes it happens, by reaſon of ſome preternatural things conteined in the Womb, as part of the ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine or after Birth, a Mole or piece of Fleſh, clodders of Blood, &amp;c. alſo, if there happen after a painful Birth, a Contuſion or great Dilaceration, that the Womb can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not rightly draw it ſelf together, but by an inverſe motion of the Fibres, aſcends upwards, and is lifted up into a bulk; alſo the membranes being affected with a Convulſion, it ſelf is ſtill tormented with torments, as if it were yet in Travel; which kind of Diſtempers, if they long continue, by reaſon of the Orifice of the Womb being tied together, with the Convulſive motion, the Lochia are oftentimes ſtopped alſo: from hence grievous ſymptoms follow, and very often the Feaver is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt excited, or it happens, being for ſome other cauſe induced, to be rendred far more dangerous. Secondly, as to the ſolution of the unity, from the cake of the Womb being broken, it comes to paſs, that the Birth, either at its juſt time, or preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous, being too much haſtened; then the ſecundine is caſt forth, either whole, or being torn, or pull'd away, part of it being left behind, it is cut off as it were in half. If the Child be born at its juſt time, and the Birth, with what inwraps it, comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the cavity of the Womb, as ripe fruit from a Tree, whole, and without violence, the mouths of Veſſels are ſomewhat unlocked, and the Lochia mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately flow; but from hence no grievous ſymptom is to be feared: but if the Child, not being yet ripe for the Birth, is pulled away, or breaks forth as it were by force, although the Cake, with the membrane is pulled away whole, yet the Veſſels being torn, a greater hemorrhage or bleeding, and at length an Ulcerous diſpoſition fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, the little mouths of the Veſſels ſpewing forth a ſtinking matter. If that part, or the whole ſecundine ſticks to the ſides of the Womb, after the Birth, it there pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifies, and ſends forth very ſtinking matter or corruption, and ſtirs up wicked diſtempers: oftentimes the Orifice of the Womb is ſhut up, and retains within gob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets of clodder'd Blood, little pieces of Membranes, or Fleſh, which putrifying, by reaſon of the heat, impoyſon the Blood and humors, flowing together to that place, by Circulation, from the whole body; alſo, by a trouble ſome itching or provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they ſtir up the parts ofo the Womb, being ſo very ſenſible, into Convulſions.</p>
                     <p>When therefore hurt is brought to the Womb, from Child-bearing, after the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid ways, the ſame is quickly communicated to other parts, not without trouble to the whole body; which thing indeed is wont to be done by a double means. For firſt, this happens, becauſe the Lochia being hindred from being thruſt forth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reſtagnate or flow back upon the maſs of Blood, and infect it as it were with a virulent taint: moreover, from the contents putrifying in the Womb, either the ſubſtance it ſelf of the matter, or the Particules coming away from the cadaverous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, are mingled with the Blood, and nervous juice, paſſing thorow that place, and quickly infect their whole liquors. Secondly, hyſterical Diſtempers, are more largely extended, by reaſon of the notable conſent, which happens between the Womb and the Brain, with the Fibres and Membranes of the whole body, by the means of the nervous paſſage: for when the extremities of the Nerves, planted about the parts of the Womb, are driven into Cramps and Convulſive motions, by reaſon ofo the preſence of ſome hurtful humor, the Convulſions there received, preſently creep more largely upwards, by the indeavours and circumduction of the Nerves, towards the Brain; and ſo it happens to the Viſcera to be ſucceſſively inflated, and cruelly haled together, and the Brain it ſelf at length to be pierced, and its functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be as it were overwhelmed: hence, from the convulſive motions, ariſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Womb, an inflation of the Belly, and hypochondria, a rumbling, vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſobbing, and ſtreightneſs of the Praecordia, difficult breathing, a ſence of choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and oftentimes a ſtupor, and want of ſpeech, or at leaſt ſome of theſe are excited: nor does the Tragedy ſo eaſily leave, but that alſo the Brain being hurt, by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the diſtemper, by that means, the evil is retorted upon other parts, that oftentimes the whole nervous ſtock is compelled into irregularities of motions; For
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:107016:83"/>what commonly is ſaid to be done by vapours, and the diſtemper, called the aſcent of vapours, creeping from the nether parts, to the upper, is nothing elſe than the parts of the Membranes, and nervous paſſages, being ſucceſſively driven into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions. Further, in theſe ſort of diſtempers, the hurt action doth not always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, or is at firſt perceived, in that region or place where the hurt is inflicted, neither do the paſſions which are called hyſterical, proceed only from the Womb; for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, the trouble is immediately brought from the Brain, or the Convulſions and Contractions begin in the extreme parts, and ſometimes the extremities of the Nerves, ſomewhere in the Viſcera, as the Stomach, Spleen, Reins, no leſs than the Womb, are haled; in which, irregularities being ariſen, they are continued into the neighbouring part, and from thence to the Brain: From whence again, the Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are reflected to other parts, and not ſeldom thorow the whole Body. Juſt ſo the buſineſs in Child-bearing Women, and with others in Feavers, as I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; to wit, ſome by reaſon of their Womb being evilly affected, but others by reaſon of a Feaveriſh matter fixed in the Brain, by a critical metaſtaſis or tranſlation, fall into paſſions like to the hyſterical. And theſe things being rightly prepenſed, concerning the praevious proviſion, in the Feavers of Women in Child-bed, there is not any thing that we ſhould ſtick at in the entrance more, ſo that we take notice that the bodies of Women lying in, (eſpecially thoſe who are feeble, and of a more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſtitution) are debilitated, chiefly after a difficult and hard Labour; ſo that, by reaſon of this occaſion only, they eaſily conceive feaveriſh intemperatures, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought in by this or any other means, they are hardly able to bear them. We will next ſpeak of the Feavers themſelves, with which Women Lying in are wont to be ſick, of which Diſtempers there are commonly recounted as it were three kinds, <hi>viz.</hi> the Milkie Feaver, the Putrid, the Symptomatic, or of that manner by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain borrowed ſymptom, but is chiefly marked with the Pleuriſie, Squinancy or the Small-Pox: of which we will diſcourſe in order.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>The Milkie Feaver.</head>
                        <p>WE have already ſaid, that as yet it was uncertain of what matter Milk was immediately made, and by what paſſages it is carried into the Breaſts, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over when this part appears not at all to anatomical inſpection, I am of the opinion, that the Milkie Chyme, being made out of aliments in the Bowels, and from thence confuſed to the Blood for nouriſhing juice, is preſently again, for the moſt part of it, ſeparated from its maſs by the help of the Glandulas in the Womb, or in the Breaſts, that it might ſupply the Child with nutriment, either in the Mothers Belly, or in her boſom by the Breaſts. In the time of going with Child, altho the greateſt part of this is derived to the Womb, yet in the laſt months, a little quantity of it is laid up in the Breaſts; but about the third or fourth day, after being brought to bed, the Milk is more plentifully carried into the Breaſts, and as it were with a certain force, that it quickly fills them to a ſtretching them forth, and begins to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. At this time, Women lying in (tho not all, yet moſt) are wont to be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a feaveriſh intemperature, with thirſt, heat, and an inquietude of the whole Body, they complain of a pain very troubleſome in the Back and Shoulders, of a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and burning of the Breaſts; and unleſs the Milk be diligently drawn forth, it being too much congeſted or heaped up, oftentimes brings forth an inflamation, with an Impoſthume following of it in the Breaſts. This Feaver, whilſt the Lochia are in good order, hardly laſts three days, but that about that ſpace it is wont to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, a plentiful ſweating ariſing of its own accord: yet this intemperature being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the coming of the Milk, is ſomewhat increaſed and continued longer, if that the Milk entring the Breaſts in abundance, be not milked forth, but is again repelled from thence; for by its departure, as well as by its coming, a perturbation is wont to happen in the whole Body, with thirſt and heat, which alſo more certainly comes to paſs if it happens to be driven away violently, by repelling Topicks. But being driven by their help from the Breaſts, or departing of its own accord, it is thruſt forth, with the Lochia, in the form of a whitiſh humor, and a ſweat, or more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful tranſpiration, exterminates the Reliques of the Diſeaſe. If that with this kind of intemperance, brought in by reaſon of the commotion of the Milk, the Lochia be ſtopped, or errors in eating and drinking be committed, or any other evident cauſe ſhould happen, that may encreaſe the fervor of the Blood, very often the Milkie
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:107016:83"/>Feaver, preſently acquiring worſe ſymptoms, changes into a putrid, or rather ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Feaver.</p>
                        <p>The cauſe, or formal reaſon of the aforeſaid Feaver (whilſt the way of the Milk lies hid) may be only propoſed, from an hypotheſis, and as it were a certain Augury; for being ſuppoſed, that this milky humor is carried to the Breaſts immediately, by a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar paſſage, from the Viſcera of concoction, without any commerce with the Blood, this feaveriſh Diſtemper ariſes, for that the Breaſts being filled with Milk, and greatly diſtended, the ſanguineous Veſſels are ſo compreſſed, that they do not eaſily tranſmit the Blood flowing thither; from whence, the Blood being hindred in its circuit, begins to tumultuate thorow its whole maſs, and the Spirits being inordinately mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and wholly confuſed, it conceives a fervor, ſuch as being induced by a ſtopping, Surfeit, Inflamation, or Wound, conſtitutes ordinarily the ſimple Synochus; but if the matter of the Milk (as it is not improbable) paſſes thorow the Blood, this Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of Women in Child-bed, ſeems to ſpring from hence, that when this Latex is transferred to the Breaſts, having left the Womb, a great portion of it ſubſiſts in the maſs of the Blood, which indeed, for that it exceeds the due proviſion of the nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing juice, and ſo cannot be wholly aſſimilated, and beſides abounds in heteroge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous parts, and as it were ſomething extraneous, and not mingleable with the Blood, creates a trouble, therefore for the carrying it forth of doors, and putting it forth, this three days feaveriſh Diſtemper is employed: For when the milky Chile, being uſed to be ſeparated about the Womb, by and by, after being Delivered of a Child, that wax of excretion is hindred, reſtagnating into the maſs of Blood, it is there firſt of all heaped up more plentifully, than that the whole may go into nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or be received into the Breaſts: wherefore, the Milk, not only in its paſſage to the Breaſts, but alſo in its return towards the Womb, brings forth the Feaver, to wit, by reaſon of either paſſage thorow the Blood.</p>
                        <p>But however the cauſe of this Diſeaſe is ordained, it matters little or nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Cure; for this is wholly committed to Nature, and ſo long as the Lochia are in good order, it proceeds for the moſt part happily, without any Phyſical help: becauſe, after the growing hot of the Blood, for three or four days, either a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſweat, or a more free tranſpiration, cures this Diſtemper, to wit, either the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Milky humor, degenerate in the aſſimulating, or the aduſt recrements, remaining after the deflagration of the Blood, or both of them at once ſupplying the food or tinder of the Feaver, are by little and little ſubdued, and evaporated out of doors, which being excluded, the Blood becoming free from the extraneous mixture, quickly recovers its priſtine condition; yet in the mean time, certain vulgar Rules are wont to be obſerved, about the admiſſion of the Milk into, or the driving away of the ſame, out of the Breaſts. If the Milk too plentifully ſprings into the Breaſts, that their inflamation, as alſo the immoderate growing hot of the Blood, may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, at that time, a more thin and ſparing dyet, to wit, no fleſh broths, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in a leſs quantity, is to be ordered: alſo the Breaſts are to be frequently drawn. If it be not commodious for the Mother to ſuckle her Child, it is uſual after the firſt or third day of her being Delivered to cover all the Breaſts over with Sear-Cloaths moderately binding (as the Plaiſter of Red-lead, &amp;c.) for ſo the ſpongious ſubſtance of the Glandulas, is ſomewhat conſtrained, or cloſed together, whereby they leſs readily receive the milky humor flowing thither, yet this kind of Remedy ought to be cautiouſly adminiſtred, leſt if the Milk be wholly excluded, or driven out of the Breaſt too abruptly, reſtagnating ſuddenly in the Blood, it induces its diſorder, the prodromus or forerunner of the Putrid or Malignant Feaver: of which it remains that we ſpeak next.</p>

                        <head>The Putrid Feaver of Women in Child-bed.</head>
                        <p>WOmen Lying in, from the fault of an evil affected Body, as by the Cotagion of a received Peſtilential Air, are found to be too obnoxious to the Putrid, or rather Malignant Feaver; but all do not alike receive the Infection of this ſort of Diſeaſe; for poor people, Labouring Women, Country Women, and others accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to hard Labour, as alſo Viragoes, and Whores, which are brought to Bed clandeſtinely, bring forth without any great difficulty, and then, after a little time, leaving their Beds, return to their wonted Labours: But more rich Women, tender and fair, and moſt living a ſedentary life, as if participating after a more grievous
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:107016:84"/>manner of the Divine Malediction, bring forth in pain, and then preſently after the Birth they are ſubject to difficult and dangerous chances; the reaſon of which ſeems to lie in this, that thoſe who are uſed to much exerciſe, continually agitate and even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate the Blood, and therefore fewer infectious taints from the monthly Flowers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuppreſſed, do gather together for the matter of a Diſeaſe; moreover, laborious and nimble Women, as they have their nervous parts more firm, therefore they are leſs ſubjected to convulſive motions, and to the paſſions commonly called hyſterical: on the contrary, in delicate, and idle Women, the maſs of Blood, in the time of their going with Child, becomes very impure and ſermentiſible; beſides, becauſe they have the ſyſtem of the Nerves, and the Brain ſoft and weak, upon every light occaſion, they ſuffer diſtractions of the animal Spirits, and inordinate motions of the nervous parts. And here, by the way, it is to be noted, that Women more than men, and that ſome of the ſame Sex before others, are ſenſible of the affections cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led hyſterical, not ſo much by the default of their Womb, as for that they are of more weak conſtitution of Brain, and nervous ſtock; for in thoſe ſo affected, the paſſions of anger, ſadneſs, fear, as alſo all troubleſome and more ſtrong objects, eaſily pervert the diſpoſitions and functions of thoſe parts, which, when they are once hurt, for the moſt part afterwards, are accuſtomed to thoſe irregularities. But we will return from whence we have digreſſed. The Feaver but now propoſed, is wont to infeſt Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Lying in, indeed at various times, and by reaſon of divers occaſions, now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after the Birth, eſpecially if it be difficult and laborious, now it ariſes in the firſt, now the ſecond, third, or fourth week; yet the ſooner it begins, the more ſafely it is wont to be cured. The Type or Figure of this Diſeaſe, is performed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt after this manner. After a previous indiſpoſition, an open feaveriſhneſs, for the moſt part with a ſhivering, or horror, conſtitutes the firſt aſſault, which is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with heat, and afterwards ſucceeds a ſeat: perhaps, for a day or two, they have various reciprocal fits of heat and cold; then the Blood being wholly inkindled, the Lochia, if not before ſuppreſſed, either flow ſmally, or are wholly ſtopt: If the Diſeaſe be acute, and of a ſwift motion, it comes to its height on the third or fourth day, then an intenſe heat, with a very troubleſom thirſt, a vehement pulſe, and quick pertinacious wakings, a great inquietude of the whole Body, that they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaully toſſing themſelves in their Beds hither and thither, a thick Urine, and high coloured, and other moſt grievous ſymptoms, are wont to trouble them: whilſt the Feaver is after this manner at its height no Criſis is to be expected; for I never ſaw this Diſeaſe cured by a critical ſweat, but that the buſineſs was ſtill very precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly acted, as after the Blood was grown hot for a little time, preſently the aduſt matter being tranſlated to the Brain, moſt dangerous and heavy inordinations of it, and the whole nervous ſtock forthwith come upon them; for moſt often are ſtirred up, convulſive motions of the Tendons, wonderful diſtentions, and inflations about the Viſcera, like to the hyſterical paſſions; then ſometimes, alſo follow a phrenſie, or dilerium, not ſeldom a ſtupefaction, and ſpeechleſsneſs; the ſtrength is ſuddenly caſt down almoſt in all, without any manifeſt cauſe, the Pulſe becomes weak, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal; and the ſick are ſuddenly precipitated to death: If that any perhaps eſcape, either by the return of the Flux of the Lochia, or a Lask, coming upon it, they hardly recover but of a long time: I have known in ſome, purple ſpots to have appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and certainly in many, ſymptoms that reſpect either the Blood or nervous juice, which argue no light Malignity.</p>
                        <p>We will diſtinguiſh the cauſes of this Feaver, after the ordinary manner, into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catartic, Evident and Cojunct. Thoſe of the firſt ſort, upon which the malignity, and the greateſt perniciouſneſs of the Diſeaſe depend, are two, <hi>viz.</hi> firſt, a depraved diſpoſition of the Blood, from the long ſuppreſſion of the monthly Flux. Secondly, after the Birth, the evil affections of the Womb, from the dangerous Labours of Women, (who undergo the Divine Malediction appointed them) from the Menſtrua being long ſuppreſſed, the Blood not only ſwells up, and its Sulphureous parts being too much carried forth, are rendred more apt for burning, but beſides, the maſs of the Blood is imbued with very fermentative Particles, ſo that (as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted) as if it were touched with a venemous infection, preſently growing fervent, it is diſpoſed towards putrefaction, and corruptive diſorders; and beſides, forthwith impoyſons the nervous Liquor, and renders it infeſtuous to the Brain and the whole nervous ſtock. Theſe kind of evils, being impreſſed on the Blood, ought to be purged forth, by the Flux of the Lochia; but if after the Birth, the Womb be
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:107016:84"/>out of order, the Lochia are not only ſtopped, and ſo a purifying of all the Blood is hindred, but beſides, ſtinking corruptions or defilements, are thence beſtowed on the Blood, and grievouſly infect it: Alſo, by reaſon of convuſlive motions, begun about the Womb, and from thence continued to other parts, inordinations are ſtirred up in the Blood and juices, which oftentimes conſpire, either the production, or the acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation or growing worſe, of the Feaver.</p>
                        <p>The evident cauſes, which induce an actual efferveſcency, either to the Blood, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving gotten an ill diſpoſition, or invert the vices of the whole Body to the Womb, are after a diverſe ſort. A painful Labour, a ſolution of the unity about the Womb, a bruiſe, a retention of preternatural things, an ulcerous diſpoſition, and very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other accidents, which are induced by a certain neceſſity, may do this. But the occaſions, that are at the diſpoſe of the Patients, and eaſily to be avoided, which are wont to excite this kind of Feaver, are chiefly two, <hi>viz.</hi> an ill manner of Dyet, and the taking of cold. It is an uſual thing, to give to weak Women, after being Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, on the firſt or ſecond day, the fleſh of living Creatures, or Broths made of fleſh meats, and other Foods, very improportionate to their diſpoſitions, from whence preſently ariſe an indigeſtion, and great trouble in the Bowels, and a feaveriſh diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Blood, by reaſon of a more rich mutritious juice than ought to be. Beſides, the errors in Dyet, oftentimes hurt is cauſed, for that their Bodies, being ſo very tender, alſo by reaſon of the labours of the Birth, and bringing forth the Child, the paſſages are on every ſide opened, they are expoſed too heedleſsly to the cold: for moſt of them, being impatient of their Bed, within a day or two, or ſooner than they ſhould do, riſe out of it, and put on their Cloaths, from whence, preſently the Pores of the skin being ſuddenly contracted, and the Air being admitted into the parts of the Womb, tranſpiration is hindred, and often the Lochia, on the ſudden are ſtopped, either of which ſuffices to excite the feaveriſh diſtemper.</p>
                        <p>The cojunct cauſe, or formal reaſon of this kind of ſickneſs, chiefly comprehends theſe three things, to wit, there are preſent, firſt, a very notable diſcraſie of the Blood, that growing hot, from the Feaver being occaſionally induced, it doth not equally burn forth, nor leiſurely overcome the aduſt recrements, and afterwards cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically thruſt them forth; but the Blood growing hot, is preſently looſned in its mixture, and its frame being unlocked, turns and declines towards corruption; hence, when it grows but a little cool, the ſpirits being ſhaken out of their domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are moved into confuſion. In the mean time, the Sulphureous Particles become untamed, and fierce, wherefore, the ſtrength falls down without any manifeſt cauſe, the Pulſe is made weak and diſordered; after the deflagration of the Blood, altho the aduſt recrements are very much heaped up, yet nothing is rightly concocted or ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but the ſick being greatly oppreſſed in Nature, tho they continually ſweat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nevertheleſs oftentimes no eaſe from thence; but the feaveriſh matter, which ought to be thruſt forth, being tranſmitted into the head, and neervous ſtock, indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces there moſt grievous perturbations of the animal regiment. Secondly, the Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this Diſeaſe owes no ſmall part of it, to the nervous juice being preſently made ſharp, and ſo improportionate to the Brain, and its Appendix; for this being infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; from the traint contracted from the Blood, doth not gently water, or pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blow up its ſubjects, but notably hale or pull thoſe tender parts, (as when an infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of vitriol is poured upon a Worm) and irritates or provokes them into convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and into motions, as if of dancing or ſuddenly leaping forth, and ſometimes wholly overturns their functions; hence comes contractures, grievous convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, dilerium, wakings, and ſometimes ſtupification, and the ſleepy Diſeaſe, upon Women Lying in. Thirdly, whilſt theſe things are done, oftentimes a third band of ſymptoms infeſt the ſick, to wit, for that the Womb, being hurt by ſome evil, moves it ſelf diſorderly, and is ſtruck with a Convulſion, according to theſe or thoſe parts, from thence by and by, convulſive motions invade, by the membranes, and nervous paſſages, the whole Region of the Abdomen; wherefore, the Viſcera and Hypocondria are blown up, belchings, and grievous vomitings are ſtirred up, then the Diſtemper creeping upwards, and poſſeſſing the nervous parts of the Thorax, a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult breathing, and unequal, a palpitation of the heart, a ſenſe of choaking in the throat, by reaſon of the Muſcles being there drawn backward, and other ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, through the whole Body are excited, the ſame evil being at laſt carried to the Brain.</p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="tcp:107016:85"/>
                        <p>The Feavers of Women in Child-bed almoſt never want danger; but ſometimes it happens, about the beginning, that they are cured by a ſlender Dyet, and by the Flux of the Lochia being reſtored; but if the feaveriſh diſtemper does root it ſelf more deeply, that the whole Blood is inkindled, and immoderately grows hot, the Prognoſtick ought not to be eſteemed of a light Omen; and there will be a greater reaſon of danger, if beſides the heat being ſuffuſed all over, the ſick are troubled with a frequent ſhivering, if they are affected or moleſted with a great diſquietneſs, and wakings, with ſudden concuſſions of the Body, or a contracture of the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons: or if, thirdly, they complain on the fourth day, of a tingling of their ears, with a great repletion or fulneſs of the head, you may from thence collect the evil to grow worſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a tranſlation of the feaveriſh and hurtful matter to the Brain; nor is it leſs to be feared, if they have on them an oppreſſion, and weight of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> that the ſick cannot breath freely, nor draw their breath deep, and from the bottom of their breaſt, but only from the top, and that frequently, and ſighingly, and that they move themſelves reſtleſly hither and thither: For this argues the Blood to ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in its circulation, about the Heart and Lungs, and alſo to be apt to grow into clodders, and to be coagulated: that if yet worſe diſtempers of the Brain and ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſtock follow, and the Pulſe ſhould become weak and unequal, you may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the buſineſs almoſt deplorable; but if (as ſometimes tho it more rarely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens) after the Feaver being inkindled, and grievouſly threatning, either the Flux of the Lochia returns, or a Diarrhea with eaſe ſucceeds, ſome hope of health may be admitted, tho the ſame beat the laſt caſt.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Cure of theſe kind of Feavers, there lies a very great task upon the Phyſitian, becauſe any Phyſick is eſteemed with the vulgar, not only unprofitable, but alſo hurtful for Women in Child-bed; wherefore, Phyſicians are rarely ſent for, unleſs when there is no place left for remedies, and the opportunity of all profitable means be wholly paſt: If that perchance they ſhould be preſent, about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, it will not be eaſie to procure health to the ſick by vulgar Remedies; but whatever they ſhould attempt, unleſs it ſhould bring help, it would be ſaid by the Women, and others about the perſon, to be deadly, and the only cauſe of her death; that in truth there is wont to happen to us, leſs of profit, or more of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miny, about the Cure of no other Diſeaſe, as in this.</p>
                        <p>But the method of curng (even as in Contagious Diſeaſes) ought to be inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted twofold; to wit, Prophylactic or Preventive, and Therapentie or Curative: The former of theſe, delivers precepts and cautions, whereby Women Lying in, may be preſerved from the aſſault of Feavers: the other ſuggeſts Curative intentions, whereby the ſick (if it may be done) may at length recover health.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Although this Feaver be ſomewhat Malignant, it is not caught by Contagion, and there is no fear of the ſicks receiving outwardly any invenomed taint; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, all Women in Child-bed, have an innate mine of virulency, and from the evil of this, as it were the tinder of moſt high Malignity, they ought to beware; wherefore, they need an exact ordering, to wit, whereby after the Birth, the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the Blood and humors, may be rightly purged forth, without danger of a Feaver; alſo, that the evil affections of the Womb, may be healed, and that the ſtrength being broken and debilitated, by the Labour, may be reſtored after its due manner. For theſe ends, theſe three things are chiefly to be inculcated, for preſcripts by Phyſitians. Firſt, I judg it neceſſary, that a moſt exact manner of Dyet be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to Women in Child-bed; to wit, that they be wholly fed with Oatmeal Caudle, made ſometimes of Beer, and ſometimes of Water and White-wine mixt together, alſo with Panada, and other light nouriſhers, for a week at leaſt; becauſe they are much emptied, therefore it may be lawful for them to ſup often, but nothing of ſolid or more ſtrong food is to be given. For I have diligently obſerved that theſe Feavers have been ofteneſt induced, by the eating too ſoon fleſh, or ſtrong Broths or Food. Foraſmuch as Women Lying in, ought to be handled, not only as thoſe that are grievouſly wounded, but as thoſe that have got a feaveriſh indiſpoſition, from a diſturbed diſpoſition and temper of the Blood: For with them, the Blood being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much carried forth, and as it were touched with an impure infection, moſt quickly catches Flame, by the acceſs or means of any Sulphureous thing. Secondly, after Dyet, the care will be, leſt the Pores by ſhut up; by the incautiouſly taking cold from without, or that the Lochia ſhould be ſtopped: for upon the leaſt occaſion, the manner of tranſpiration being changed, the Blood firſt growing hot, conceives diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders:
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:107016:85"/>orders: alſo the Womb being touched by the blaſt of Air, contracts it ſelf, and ſhuts up the mouths of the Veſſels, whereby the Lochia flow forth leſs: wherefore, for five days at leaſt, after being Delivered, I would have Women wholly to keep their Beds. I know that 'tis a common cuſtom, to raiſe them from Bed on the third day, but by that means I have known many that have fallen into Feavers; and in truth, if we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to keep Women in Child-bed from all danger, the ſafeſt means will be, that they may be kept long in their Beds. Thirdly, concerning preſervation, the intent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, that by cauſing a gentle provocation of the Blood, in Women Lying in, the Flux of the Lochia may be continued: for this end, Midwives are wont (if after a difficult Labour they fear that evil) to give them <hi>Sperma Ceti,</hi> or powder of <hi>iriſh</hi> Slate, or Saffron ſteeped in White-wine: Moreover, to make them Oat-meal Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, that may more fuſe the Blood, of Water, and White and Rheniſh Wine mixed together, in which they boyl, or in poſſet drink alſo, Marigold Flowers, leaves of Penyroyal, or Mugwort, there are many other kinds of adminiſtrations extant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ordering Women in Child-bed, which being commonly known, I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly paſs over-here.</p>
                        <p>The Cure of the ſubſequent Feaver of Women in Child-bed, is far from the uſual method in Putrid Feavers: for in this, it is not to be expected, that the Blood being touched with a feaveriſh burning, ſhould by degrees burn forth, and the ſame ſhould be ſeparated by a Criſis, but rather (as it is done in a Malignant Feaver) as ſoon as the Blood grows immoderately hot, it is convenient for it to be moved by gentle Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick Remedies, and its hererogeneous and impure mixtures to be carried forth of doors; wherefore, among the common people it is a cuſtom (and that not bad) to give to feaveriſh Women Lying in, ſudorificks preſently: by this means, the Blood being eventilated, its effervency is allayed; alſo, by reaſon of its agitation, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia apt to be reſtrained, are provoked into a Flux. There is great difference among Authors, from whence the beginnings of theſe kind of Feavers ought to be compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>viz.</hi> whether from the Birth it ſelf, or from the firſt ſenſe of growing feaveriſh? however it matters little whether it be after this or that manner: For ſince this Feaver runs not the uſual ſtadia or courſes of the Putrid, neither hath a Criſis, nor wholly admits the uſe of Cathartic or Purging Remedies, we need not be ſolicitous ſo much for the days, concerning its period and menſuration. But yet, as to the Curative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications, it will be of uſe only to diſtinguiſh what is to be done in the beginning, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and end of this Diſeaſe: alſo, what we ought to indeavour whilſt there is ſome ſtrength remaining, as alſo what, when 'tis oppreſſed, and very much deje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                        <p>When therefore any Woman in Child-bed is firſt taken with this Feaver (whoſe aſſault is known from the milky Feaver, becauſe for the moſt part it begins with a ſhivering) you muſt preſently let it be your work, tha tthe more plentiful ſuſtenance may be drawn away from the burning Blood, and as I have already admoniſhed, that the fleſh of living Creatures, and Broths made of them, be utterly forbidden; yet in the mean time, all cold things, and that are indued with a ſtyptic or binding vertue, are equally to be avoided; for theſe fix the Blood, and bind it too much, and hinder its very requiſite Purgation, both by the Lochia, and by tranſpiration thorow the skin. But rather, though the Feaver be urgent, give them decoctions, powders, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of things moderately hot: of which ſort are, (as is already ſaid) decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or Diſtilled Waters of the Flowers of Marigoids, the Leaves of Pennyroyal, Mugwort, the roots of Scorzonera, alſo Bezoartic Powders, Spirits of Harts-horn, fixed ſalts of Herbs, &amp;c. If the Lochia ſhould be ſtopt, that their Flux may be again provoked, muſt be indeavoured every way: To the moving of this, conduce fricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ligatures about the Thighs and Legs; ſometimes Cupping-Glaſſes, or Bli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters about the Thighs or Hips, alſo in the ſoles of the Feet: alſo, ſometimes the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening a Vein in the Ankle is convenient, in the mean time a fomentation of the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterical decoction, is to be applied about the Pubis, or the Caul of a Weather or Sheep, taken out warm, may be layed to the bottom of the Belly; and experience manifeſts, that ſometimes injections into the Womb are profitable: If the Belly yields not, it may be gently brought down, with a violet ſuppoſitory ſo called, or an emol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lient Clyſter; of more ſtrong provocations you muſt take heed, becauſe in Women Lying in, even as in a Malignant Feaver, from a copious dejection, with loſs of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, Life is quickly loſt. If with the ſuppreſſion of the Lochia, there be a notable perturbation of the Blood, with vomiting, thirſt, and wakings, I have often known,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:107016:86"/>Laudanum mixt with Saffron, given with happy ſucceſs. Inſtead of a cooling Julep, this kind of mixture is convenient, <hi>viz.</hi> take of water of Pennyroyal, and Balm, each three ounces, of hyſterical water two ounces, of the Syrrop of Mugwort three ounces and an half, of the tincture of Saffron two drams, of Caſtor ry'd in a rog, and hung in the glaſs, one ſcruple, mingle theſe, and let them drink of this three or four ſpoonfuls oftentimes in a day.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. If notwithſtanding the uſe of theſe Remedies the Feaver grows ſtill worſe, and by degrees is increaſed with worſer ſymptoms, that beſides the diſorders of the Blood, the Brain and nervous parts begin to be touched, Medicines, tho many of every kind may be rayed, do little; yea, in this caſe the indications are almoſt the ſame, with thoſe made uſe of in the Plague it ſelf: foraſmuch as the Lochia being for a good while ſuppreſſed, they cannot eaſily be reduced, or ſcarcely at all, in the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the Blood and humors, therefore it is convenient quickly to move a ſweat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to wit, that the corruptions, impreſſed on the Blood and nervous juice, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtagnating from the Womb, may be carried forth ſome how, by ſweat, and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tranſpiration. Therefore here, Powders, and Confections of Bezoar, Spirit of Hartshorn, or of Soot, tinctures of Corals or Pearls help. I have ſometimes ſeen, by the help of theſe kind of Medicines, in a deſperate caſe, when the Pulſe, and other ſymptoms have appeared a little better, ſome ſmall hopes to ſhew themſelves; yet Cure rarely to follow: but when the uſe of theſe Cordials were left off, the ſick with a weak Pulſe, and a Looſneſs preſently ariſing, have been precipitated to Death.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. When yet the buſineſs of the ſick proves ſtill worſe, when the Feaver being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the Pulſe is weak and unequal, and frequent horrors, and convulſive moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the whole body, with a delitium, and ſtupefaction infeſt them; then the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian having firſt made a Prognoſtication of Death, may inſiſt upon a few Remedies, and thoſe only Cordials, and muſt wholly abſtain from blood-letting, ſcarification, bliſtering, or the uſe of Cupping-glaſſes: for ſuch adminiſtrations beget only an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um and blame, that by ſo doing, we are eſteemed by ſome Women, as wicked and cruel.</p>

                        <p>THE Acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child-bed, ſhew themſelves not only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Figure of the aforeſaid Feaver, but ſometimes they are beſet with ſome ſignal ſymptoms, to wit, the Squinancy, Pleurifie, inflamation of the Lungs, Dyſentery, Small-Pox, or of ſome other kind; and at that time, they get the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of thoſe Diſtempers. It will not be here ſeaſonable, to repeat at large, what belongs to the eſſences and natures of each: but I ſhall Briefly ſhew, what theſe ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, being complicated with the diſtempers of Women Lying in, contain peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly, as to the Cauſes or Cures.</p>
                        <p>All theſe ſymptoms, we ſuppoſe to proceed, from a certain Coagulation of the Blood, and from thence its extravaſation: But whilſt the Blood is extravaſated, or put forth of the Veſſels in one part, its efflux, however natural, and critical, is hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in another: wherefore it is dangerous, leſt whilſt the Blood begins to be coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, either in a particular or accuſtomed neſt of Coagulation, or univerſally in its whole maſs, the flowing of the Lochia be ſtopped, which in truth for the moſt part happens, and therefore theſe Diſtempers, for the moſt part, are deadly to Women in Child-bed: yet the cauſe of their Death, for the moſt part, happens with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Small Pox, the flowing of the Lochia, draws inwardly the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, begun to be carried forth outwardly, and forthwith compels the maſs of Blood, and the heart it ſelf, to be impoyſoned, with its evil; and therefore in the Small Pox, theſe purgings of the Womb, are convenient to be ſtopped: But in the Pleuriſie, Squinancy, and the reſt, when the provocative of the Diſeaſe, being fixed here or there, in a particular place, draws to it ſelf the impurities of the Blood, which ought to be ſeparated or ſifted forth by the Lochia, and derives it ſtreight from the Womb, for that reaſon it increaſes the impurity of the Blood. The Lochia being ſtopped in the Small Pox, by the more univerſal manner or way of excretion, may be ſhut forth of doors, with the venemous Particles of the Diſeaſe, which thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does not ſucceed in the reſt, by reaſon of the minute, and more ſparing manner of excretion.</p>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:107016:86"/>
                        <p>Of theſe, the Squinancy, Pleuriſie, and Inflamation of the Lungs, by reaſon, both of the great ſimilitude of the Cauſe, and analogy of the Cure, may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together: when any Woman Lying in is diſtempered with any of theſe, it is to be ſuppoſed, that beſides the Infection, gathered together in the time of being Big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellied, there happens a certain ſouriſh diſpoſition of the Blood, by the means of which, whilſt that it ſelf grows feaveriſhly hot, certain Particles of it, being fuſed with the ſourneſs enter into congelation, in this or that part, like Milk growing ſour, and then to be coagulated: The Blood being there frozen or congealed, and hindred in its circuit, ſtops the paſſage of the reſt; but the Blood being obſtructed in its motion, buts againſt the impediment, and ſo being heaped up about it, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth of the Veſſels, grows into a tumour: from thence preſently, whatſoever is contained in its maſs, that is heterogeneous, and to be ſifted forth, is layed aſide into the diſtempered part, as it were a ſink: wherefore, the corruptions of the Blood, that ought to be purged forth by the Womb, are derived from thence towards the neſt of this Diſeaſe, which, when they cannot be ſufficiently purged forth by this way, both more remarkably corrupt the Liquor of the Blood, and render the particular diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the Squinancy, Pleurifie, or any other more hard to be cured.</p>
                        <p>For the Cure of theſe kind of complicated diſtempers, preſently from the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, it ſhould be endeavoured, that the Blood being fixed ſomewhere, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to be extravaſated, may be reſtored to Circulation, that it may not impoſtumate; becauſe, very rarely, Women Lying in, are cured of theſe Symptomatic Feavers, by an Impoſthume, or ſpitting forth of the corrupt matter: Wherefore, internal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, which fuſe the Blood, and free it from Coagulation, are to be made uſe of; of which ſort are chiefly Diaphoretics full of a volatile Salt, as Spirit of Hartshorn, Soot, Urine, alſo the Salts themſelves; in like manner Shelly and Bezoartic Powders, Lapis Prunellae, Decoctions and Juleps of Vegetables provoking Urine, or the terms, with all which ought to be mixed, what by experience are found proper for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of the Womb: Beſides, diſcuſſing Remedies, which may drive away the impacted matter, and diſperſe it (of which ſort are Liniments, Fomentations, and Cataplaſms) are diligently to be applied. In the mean time, the more impetuous motion, and immoderate effervency of the Blood, are to be removed, and its purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by all the ways poſſible transferred to the inferior parts. For this end Frictions, Ligatures, Epiſpaſtics, and (if need be) Scarifying about the Feet and Legs, are to be adminiſtred; if the diſtemper very much growing worſe, a taking away of Blood be indicated, unleſs there be a great fulneſs in the whole Body, and a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute inflamation in the diſtempered part; it will be beſt to open a Vein in the Foot, or to take away Blood from the hemorrhoid Veins by Leeches: But if neceſſity urges, it may be done in the Arm it ſelf; if after that Letting Blood (if another be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) let it be done in the Leg; but you are to be warned, that in theſe caſes, the opening a Vein is to be ordered very cautiouſly, for unleſs it brings preſent help, (which I have rarely known it to do) immediately the Pulſe being made more weak, the buſineſs of the ſick becomes much worſe.</p>
                        <p>The Dyſentery takes its riſe almoſt for the like cauſe, with the aforeſaid diſtempers; but in this, becauſe the extravaſated Blood is preſently poured forth, nor being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Body, becomes there troubleſome, or is any more corrupted, and as this Flux makes an excretion near the Womb, and does not afterwards dreive it to any other place, there is leſs of danger to be feared, from this Diſeaſe, than from thoſe aforeſaid: yet oftentimes this Diſeaſe is fatal to Women in Child-bed, for that indeed, the rather, becauſe things attempering the Blood, and moderately binding, are ordered for the Dyſentery: for theſe are found too apt to inhibit the Flux of the Luchia; wherefore in this caſe, until the Women Lying in are ſufficiently purged by a long Flux, the Cure of the other Diſeaſe is to be omitted, and the fierceneſs of the ſymptoms is to be allayed, only with gentle aſſwaging things.</p>
                        <p>The indications of the Small Pox, do not only differ from thoſe above deſcribed, but indeed they are beſet with contraries to themſelves; for they require (as hath been ſaid) that the Flux of the Lochia ſhould be moderately ſtaid: yet in the mean time, that the flowring forth of the Blood, and a gentle ſweat ought to be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for when in this Diſeaſe, the invenomed ferment is twofold, and the corrupt Particles of the Blood, are carried outwardly in a twofold way, you muſt beware, leſt that the leſſer, and ſtraiter part, ſhould draw to its door, the whole matter, or more than it were able to ſend forth: therefore, leſt the Lochia flowing more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully,
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:107016:87"/>ſhould recall inwardly the venom, apt to flower outwardly, the manner or way of Dyet is ſomewhat to be changed, and ſpecially thoſe things which have a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon reſiſting force, and are alſo aſtringent (as the roots of Tormentil and Biſtort) are to be boyled in the Broths of the ſick; alſo Powders, Juleps, and Opiats, indued with ſuch like virtue, are convenient to be adminiſtred at due intervals: yea, in this caſe, by no means, Women ſhould be indulged, that they might eat fleſh, or Broth made of it, or to riſe out of their Bed: but the quiet, both of mind and Body, is to be procured, as much as may be, and a Dyet to be ordered of thoſe things, that move not the Blood, and the buſineſs almoſt wholly to be committed to God and Nature.</p>
                        <p>What hath already been ſaid, concerning the acute Diſeaſes of Women in Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, may eaſily be illuſtrated with Hiſtories and Obſervations: But examples which may be brought in this thing, for the greateſt part, are mournful and of an ill chance: becauſe thoſe Feavers for the moſt part end in Death. But to deſcribe theſe kind of ſickneſſes, does neither confirm the work of the Phyſitian, nor render ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the method of Medicine, altogether taken in them; however, becauſe the knowledg of theſe may make for the better diſcovery of this Diſeaſe, I ſhall here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome ſingular caſes of Women Lying in, and variety of ſymptoms; in which, altho the forms and means of Cure more ſparingly occur, yet we may have ſome rules of precaution, of no contemplable uſe.</p>
                        <p>A Gentlewoman in her ſix and twentieth year of her Age, brought forth her ſixth Child, with very difficult Labour, and not without danger of her Life; yet preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after, ſhe began to be better; on the ſecond day ſhe eat a whole Chicken, on the third roſe out of her Bed, and ſate in a Chair for four hours; the night following ſhe found her ſelf ill, at which time her Milk came into her Breaſts; which, by the application of Diaculum Plaiſters, ſoon vaniſhed; the next morning ſhe complained of a wearineſs, and as it were an ulcerous pain of her whole Body, alſo of a vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nauſeouſneſs, and fulneſs about the Ventricle, and Hypochondria: the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night was full of trouble; on the fifth day ſhe was plainly in a Feaver, ſhe felt now a ſhivering, now a heat, every where increaſing, ſhe nauſeated every thing, and was troubled at her Stomach, moreover being unquiet, and without ſleep, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia flowed little, but a whitiſh humor (commonly called the Flux of the Milk) came away: In the evening ſhe had a weight, and as it were a ſleepineſs about her forehead and temples, and began to ſleep a little; but awaking in half an hour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſturbed with Phantaſms, ſhe complained of her head, as if increaſed in bulk, alſo of her jaws being ſet, that ſhe could not open her teeth, and her fiſts being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clutched, ſhe ſeemed as if ſhe felt a pricking and ſlupor, or numneſs in her whole Body; her Ventricle and Hypochondria ſtood ſtill inflated, and ſtretched forth; they adminiſtred to her Frictions, Ligatures, Cupping-glaſſes, and other Remedies, both inward and outward, that might recall the Lochia, and drive the recrements of the Blood from the head: Her Pulſe being weak, and diſordered, would not admit of Letting Blood; Powders, and Juleps, which might gently move ſweating, and fuſe the Blood and nervous juice, and hinder them from reſtagnating, were diligently gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her; yea, ſomentations, now of Wollen Cloaths dipped in empollient Decoctions, and now of warm inwards of living Creatures, were applied to her Belly; in the mean time, ſtinking things (ſuch as they uſe to the Mother Fits) were put to her noſe, which might drive away the impetuouſneſs of the Spirits and Blood, carried into the head, but theſe, and other things, being for ſeveral hours carefully perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, ſhe ſeem'd to feel ſome eaſe; but ſtill ſhe feared to ſhut her eyes, or to ſettle herſelf to ſleep, for her eye lids being cloſed, a thouſand Phantaſms ran in her mind, with noiſe and tingling in her whole head: ſhe continued that night almoſt without ſleep; aſſoon as ſhe had begun to ſleep, preſently being affrighted, and feeling a weight in her Precordia, ſhe was awaked: on the ſixth day about noon, ſhe was troubled with a great ſhivering, or rather an horror, with a ſtrong concuſſion of the whole Body; to which, as in the fit of an Ague, by and by heat, and then ſweat co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly followed: but from thence, nothing of eaſe accrued to the ſick, for preſently after the ſweat, the feaveriſh heat was renewed, and convulſive diſtempers infeſted her more: the night following, with the reſt of the ſymptoms growing worſe, firſt a Palſie was excited in her tongue, and by and by in her throat, that ſhe could not ſpeak, and ſcarce ſwallow at all: on the ſeventh day, about the ſame hour, a ſhive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring invaded her again, with heat and ſweat; then her Pulſe being much weaker,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:107016:87"/>and unequal; alſo a difficult breathing, and fetching the breath ſhort and quick, with her Breaſt lifted up, ſhe knew not them about her: on the eighth day ſhe died.</p>
                        <p>There was a manifold occaſion of the death of this Gentlewoman, prediſpoſed to a Feaver, by reaſon of her Big-belly, and which had increaſed the malignity of the Diſcaſe over and above; for the hurt received by her hard Labour, the ſudden exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Milk from her Breaſts, the earing of fleſh, and the riſing too ſoon out of her bed, hapning together, made as it were a conſpiration for the greater evil: The Blood being touched with a feaveriſh burning, preſently conceived inordinations, and ſnatched into it ſelf the Lochia, and perhaps other defilements of the Womb, and ſo by that means acquired a greater infection, and plainly venemous diſpoſition; the membranes of the Viſcera, being imbrued with the degenerate nervous juice, were ſtruck either with Convulſive motions, or with Convulſions continued to them from the Womb; for theſe kind of inflations, about the Abdomen, and thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentions are the effects of Convulſions: For altho the direct Fibres drawing the member do oftentimes preſs it, yet ſince the Fibres are direct and tranſverſe, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers placed in a various ſite, the membranes are pulled together into an hollowneſs, by their coming together, the part ſwells up like a blown bladder, into whoſe vacuity the Air being rarefied ſecondarily carries it ſelf forward: But it is not the Air (as is commonly ſaid) or a blaſt there at firſt heaped up, that is the cauſe of the diſtention. The Blood growing hot in our ſick perſon, and being quickly filled with an aduſt and malignant matter, did endeavour to ſubdue it, and being unable to put it forth by ſweat, forthwith fixed it in the Brain; the firſt ſuffuſion of the ſame matter into the head, by reaſon of the animal Spirits being half overthrown, brought in that ſenſe of her head being much increaſed in bulk; which thing happened by the like means, as when the foot being taken with a ſleepineſs, ſeems as if it felt much bigger than it is: But that after ſome eaſe, the diſtemper grew worſe, by ſleep and cloſing of her eyes, the reaſon is, becauſe waking, and the exerciſe of the ſenſes, ſhake off and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from them, ſomewhat, the matter beſieging the Brain and Nerves; which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding being neer and in its precincts, ſleep creeping on, is as it were ſupped up by them, and enters their Bodies more deeply with the alible juice. But the Blood, altho it had plentifully poured forth its recrements in the Brain, yet did not itſelf become free; but being ſtill full, with an impure ballaſt, it conceived as it were a critical flowring, and attempted to ſhake off its burthen once or twice (as it is wont in a great excretion) with a ſhivering, and with heat and ſweat following it, by which endeavour however nothing was further effected, than that the matter ſticking to the Brain, pierced more deeply into it, and becoming fixed in ſome little ſhoots of the Nerves, took away her ſpeech and ſwallowing, and afterwards her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and maſs of Blood, being by degrees more and more depraved, at length be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came unable to ſuſtain Life.</p>
                        <p>A noble Gentlewoman, being married a little before ſhe was twenty years of Age, and being with Child, uſed, during the time, an ill dyet, and little or no exerciſe; yet falling into Labour, and ſuffering the torments with intermiſſion, and frequent cafe for twelve hours, at length was brought to Bed of a Son: The Child, with the after-birth came away, and all things were right about the Womb: the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond day ſhe found her ſelf indifferently well, but on the third, after a light ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe began to complain of thirſt and heat; to which a looſneſs followed, that ſhe had that day four ſtools: the following night ſhe was almoſt without fleep, the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh diſtemper remained, after that, in the ſame manner for two days; daily ſhe purged three or four time; the Lochia as yet flowed moderately: when on the ſixth day, by the perſuaſion of the Women, ſhe had took ſome aſtringent thing, to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Flux of her Belly, the hpurgings of the Womb were almoſt wholly ſtayed: at which time the Feaver became more ſtrong, and ſymptoms as it were hyſterical ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; for in her Precordia, ſhe had great and frequent oppreſſions, and was troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a ſenſe of choaking in her throat; on the ſeventh day, the heat was yet ſtronger, and her breathing difficult and laborious; but then, by the preſcription of a Phyſician, at that time firſt ſent for, Blood was taken from her foot to three ounces, by which ſhe was better for four hours; for a quiet ſleep, with a plentiful ſweat fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon it, and the Lochia appeared again tho in ſmall quantity: In the Evening again, all things grew worſe, her ſtrength being very much loſt, her Pulſe weaker and unequal; ſhe complained alſo of a noiſe and tingling of her ears, with a fulneſs of her head, moreover a leaping up of the tendons in her wriſts; alſo ſhe had ſudden
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:107016:88"/>concuſſions of her wholy Body, yet ſtill her looſneſs held; to her were adminiſtred, by the preſcripts of ſeveral Phyſicians, Cordials, and other Remedies, and kinds of Adminiſtrations carefully, but nothing profited: her Pulſe being more weak, and her ſtrength leiſurely waſting, ſhe died on the ninth day, after ſhe was delivered.</p>
                        <p>This Feaver very much depended upon the vitious proviſion of the Body, as the procatartic cauſe; for I have often obſerved, that it ſates ill with Women Lying in, who when Big bellied devoured fruit, and any unwholſom traſh, and living without motion or exerciſe, indulged themſelves with eaſe and reſt: the Blood, by reaſon of the previous Cachexie, conceived a burning without any evident cauſe, as it were of its own accord: But growing hor, laying inwardly ſtill its recrements, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, cauſed the Diarrhea: neither yet was its maſs made more pure, by its almoſt continual excretion, yea, rather being ſtill more depraved in its mixtion or craſis, the Blood at length wholly departed from its proper diſpoſition, and became unable to be fermented in the heart, whereby heat and breath might be every where diſperſed: The looſneſs, excited by the motion of Nature, was untowardly ſtopped, eſpecially by the uſe of aſtringent things; for this I have often obſerved, never to be done without paying for it; becauſe the Flux of the Belly has cured ſome that have been ill, but in this Lady, and in many others (as has abundantly appeared to our experience) altho it did not take away the Feaver, yet it freed her from the more grievous diſtempers of the Brain and nervous ſtock: from whence this ſick perſon was wholly free from a Delirium, nor was ſtruck with Convulſive motions, till reduced almoſt to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.</p>
                        <p>The Mother of a Family, and a Gentlewoman, about 36 years of Age or upwards, being with Child of her ſerventeenth Child, was troubled, and very anxious, leſt ſhe ſhould die of that Child-bearing: But (God favouring) ſhe was delivered well enough of a Son, and for three days after ſhe was very cheerful: on the fourth day, when ſhe had eaten more than ſhe ſhould do of a Chicken, a little before night ſhe fell into a feaveriſh Diſtemper, with vomiting, and a ſtopping of the Lochia: all night ſhe lay reſtleſs and without ſleep, the next morning ſhe had four ſtools, and ſeemed ſomewhat eaſed: about Noon (about which time I came to her) ſhe complained again of heat and thirſt, as alſo a palpitation of the heart, and of the aſcent of ſome ſubſtance in her throat; her Pulſe was quick and ſmall, her Urine red, the Lochia ſcarce appeared: I ordered her Juleps, Cordials, and things to purge the Womb, beſides a ſomentation for the bottom of her Belly, alſo her Legs and Feet to be rubbed often, with warm Wollen Cloaths; at going to ſleep I gave her of Laudanum one grain, with Saffron Pouder half a ſcruple, in a ſpoonful of Treacle-water: She ſlept well, and the Lochia came down plentifully, and by that means, with a ſlender dyet, and continuing to provoke moderately the Flux of the Womb, for a few days, ſhe became very well.</p>
                        <p>The immoderate eating of fleſh, as an evident and almoſt only ſufficient cauſe, without any great proviſion, or vitious prediſpoſition, induced the Feaver. The Lochia reſtagnating into the Blood, increaſed its intemperance, and preſently brought troubles upon the nervous kind; but in the mean time, the Blood altho growing hot, did not undergo any great corruption, but when the recrements, heaped up by the Surfeit, were ſent forth by the looſneſs, and the Blood, the Lochia being reſtored, began to be purged forth again after its wonted manner, this Feaver wanting a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther malignant ferment, quickly vaniſhed.</p>
                        <p>A noble Lady, young, and fair, was brought to Bed of a ſecond Child, and for ſix days, as to the Lochia and other accidents, ſhe was well, and wholly free from the ſuſpicion of any intemperature: ſhe ate fleſh daily, and riſing from her Bed, was brisk and chearful in her Chamber; on the ſeventh day, without any manifeſt cauſe, a ſhivering came upon her, with a Feaver, and a leſſning of the Lochia, but not ſupproſſed: to the tenth day after her Delivery, ſhe was only moderately feaveriſh; whilſt the purgings of the Womb yet flowed, ſhe remained free from any grievous ſymptom: but then, although ſhe was greatly ſeaveriſh, ſhe was more cheerful than ordinary, and ſeemed more confident of her health: at Night ſhe ſlept little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; the morning following (at which time I firſt viſited her) ſhe clearly raved, the Lochia were ſtopped, alſo her whole Body was ſhaken with horror, the tendons in her wriſts were pulled together, ſo that I could hardly diſtinguiſh her Pulſe, which in the mean time was weak, unequal, and very quick. I ſaid ſhe would die quickly, unleſs God ſhould miraculouſly reſtore her by his Divine Power, however, ſix grains
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:107016:88"/>of Oriental Bezoar being given her, in a ſpoonful of Cordial Julep, brought upon her a plentiful ſweat, with a better Pulſe; then other Cordials being given, with due inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, gave ſome little hopes, tho I doubted they would not continue: after four hours from the time that I came, the ſick Lady had of her own accord a great Stool, and preſently her ſtrength wholly failed her, and within half an hour ſhe died.</p>
                        <p>When there hapned nothing of ill to this Lady, as to her Delivery, or Womb, ſo permicious a Feaver, and ſo ſuddenly Mortal, could not happen without a great and malignant procatarſis of the Blood and humors: whether a more full Dyet, or taking Cold, or any other evident cauſe, gave a beginning to this is uncertain; becauſe, the Women and Nurſes helping her, knew of no manifeſt occaſion of her ſickneſs: The Feaver being inkindled, the infection of the Blood could not be wholly carried away, by the purging of the Womb, tho long continued; tho for that reaſon, the more cruel ſymptoms came not preſently upon her, yet the evil ſtill lurked within, and the Diſeaſe being very acute, ſhewing it ſelf with a ſwiſt motion, on the fourth day, when Nature ſhould have indeavoured a Criſis, the matter of the Feaver being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but not overcome, as it were in a moment overturned at once, the Brain and nervous parts, whence Death was to be expected, and ſuddenly followed.</p>
                        <p>A Woman well known, who had ſcarce paſſed the twentieth Year of her Age, of a florid countenance, and ſlender Body, after her being brought to Bed, when the Lochia flowed immoderately, made uſe of ſome aſtringent Remedies, by the counſel of thoſe about her, by which means they were wholly ſtopped; but a Flux of her belly ſucceeded, which when it had increaſed for three days, the Women gave her other things for the ſtopping her Looſneſs: nor were they fruſtrated in the ſucceſs; in the mean time, in the place of the former evil, they had brought a moſt dangerous Feaver, and diſtempers as it were hyſterical: for the unhappy Gentlewoman Lying in, was troubled with thirſt, heat, wakings, and at ſeveral turns, with ſwoonings, and cold ſweats; at this time being ſent for, I preſcribed her Cardaic Remedies, and ſuch as moved the purgings of the Womb, and alſo a Clyſter to be given her: at length, the Flux of her Belly being provoked, the Lochia alſo came down, and the ſick Woman being freed from the aforeſaid ſymptoms, and the more grievous Diſeaſe, to wit, the Remedies of the Nurſes, quickly grew well of her Feaver.</p>
                        <p>The more plentiful Flux of the Womb, hapning to this Woman, removed the Procatartic cauſe of a more grievous Diſeaſe: wherefore, when they had committed ſo many errors about the ordering her, (<hi>viz.</hi> firſt in ſtopping the Lochia, then what might compenſate their defect, in hindring the Flux of her Belly) yet the Feaver was only light, and without any venomous taint impreſſed on the Blood; the like to this I have known to happen frequently, to wit, when at firſt the purgings of the Womb have flown very plentifully, afterwards when they have flown very ſparingly, and ſometimes ſtopped, the women in Child-bed have eſcaped. And by the way, it is here to be noted, that it is wholly dangerous, to inhibit, or at leaſt divert, and croſs and motion of Nature, incited, tho irregular.</p>
                        <p>A Noble Gentlewoman, about 20 years of Age, indued with a ſmooth and full habit of Body, miſcarried twice in the ſpace of a Year; when ſhe had again Concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, by the preſcription of her Phyſician, ſhe provoked a Vomit once a month, by drinking plentifully Poſſet Drink, by which ſhe was wont to caſt forth much thick tough Phlegm; alſo in the time of her being with Child, he Let her Blood 5 times; the time of her going being over, ſhe was brought to Bed of a Son, with very hard Labour; the Secundine came whole away, and ſhe purged notably: on the ſecond day, whilſt ſhe was lifted upon her feet in Bed, that the Sheets and the Blankets might be laid in better order, ſhe took Cold, and by that means the bloody Lochia wholly ſtopped, and only a little ſerous Water came away: on the third day ſhe began to complain of an acute pain in her right ſide, to which the Women laid Bags of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>momil made hot with Bricks, but the diſtemper grew worſe with a bloody ſpittle; on the fourth day of her being brought to Bed, a moſt ſharp pain, with a difficult breathing, and very Laborious, invaded her: by the preſcription of her Phyſician, then coming to her from the neigbourhood, ſix ounces of Blood was taken away, out of the Baſilic vein, and ſhe felt ſudden eaſe, for 10 hours ſhe was better, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the night the pricking pain returned with its wonted fierceneſs: at length, other Phyſicians being called to Counſel, they agreed that it was neceſſary to open a Vein again, in the arm of the diſtempered ſide: four ounces of Blood being taken away, the pain remitted, and the ſick breathed better; then by Diaſphoretic Remedies, ſhe
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:107016:89"/>fell into a great ſweat, with a quiet ſleep: But the Pulſe was made quicker and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, alſo contractures of the tendons in her wriſts appeared: preſently afterwards ſhe talked idly, and within 24 hours, after ſhe was laſt Let Blood, ſhe departed.</p>
                        <p>That this Lady fell into a Pleuriſie, with a Feaver, upon the Lochia being ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the cauſe in ſome meaſure ſeemed to be, the Letting of Blood ſo often in the time of her being with Child: for by this means, the Blood being accuſtomed to be even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilated at the arm, afterwards growing hot, leaving the Womb, was carried violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards the place of its letting forth, where, when it found not a paſſage, it fixed in the neighbouring ſide, as thenexe neſt to the place of extravaſation; yea, beſides the uſual manner of a Pleuriſie, there was no ſmall malignity hapned to this Diſeaſe; for the Blood being hindred from being let forth of the Veſſels, began preſently to be corrupted in its diſpoſition, and in the third day of the Feaver, was ſo much depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it could not be any longer fermented in the heart ſo as to Prorogue Life.</p>
                        <p>It was not ſo with the Wife of a certain Smith, who was brought to Bed, at what time her Children had the Small Pox in the ſame Houſe, and ſhe her ſelf, as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, had taken the Contagion of the ſame Diſeaſe, for on the ſecond day after her Delivery, they began to break forth with a feaveriſh heat, and pain in her Loyns, which indeed for three days, whilſt the Lochia moderately flowed, aroſe rightly into little ſwellings; altho the purging of the Womb was very copious at that time, ſhe had the Small Pox very thick all over her Body, not only in the ſuperficies of her skin, but alſo they filled the cavity of her mouth and throat, ſo that ſhe could ſcarce ſpeak or ſwallow: The ſixth day of her Lying in, the Lochia flowed immoderately, from whence preſently fell upon the ſick, a frequent ſwooning, with a flagging of the Small Pox, Convulſions, and other ſymptoms of an ill nature, which threatned Death ſoon; being ſent for, I preſcribed half a dram of this Powder, to be taken conſtantly every three hours, in a ſpoonful of the following Julep, <hi>viz.</hi> take of the Roots of Tormentil in Powder, drams two, of the beſt Bole Armonie, dram one, of the ſpecies of Hyacinth half a dram, make a Powder. Take of the Compound Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Scordium, of Dragons, of Meadowſweet, each three ounces, of There cal Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar one ounce, of the Syrup of Corals two ounces, of Harts-horn burnt half a dram, make a Julep. Beſides, I ordered to be boyled in her Broths, and in every thing ſhe drank, the Roots of Totmentil: by theſe Remedies, the purging of her Womb was ſoon wholly ſtopped, and the Small Pox by degrees being ripened, came off without any grievous ſymptom.</p>
                        <p>Indeed this caſe was difficult, and was cured with great danger, <hi>viz.</hi> for either the Lochia, or the Small Pox to have been reſtrained inwardly, was very dangerous, and yet the more full eruption of the one, hindred the motion of the other; ſo long as either moderately proceeded, things being permitted to the conduct of Nature was moderately well: but when one of them became ill, the work of Art was required, and it was requiſite to bridle the Lochia, but to provoke the Small Pox.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XVII.</hi> Of Epidemical Feavers.</head>
                     <p>HAving meditated rather a Commentary, than an intire Tract, I had thought here to have concluded our Diſcourſe of Feavers: But foraſmuch as certain Epidemical Feavers do often ſpread, which obſerve no Laws, nor can be brought to any certain rule of Doctrine, but being irregular vary every year, and for that reaſon, as often as any of them increaſe or ſpread abroad, preſently it is called the new Diſeaſe; therefore, I thought it worth out while, becauſe general precepts concerning theſe Feavers are not to be delivered, to ſubjoyn ſome particular Hiſtories, of ſome of this kind; for out of the various proviſion of ſymptoms, whereby they are wont to be noted, the nature and the whole formal reaſon of theſe kind of diſtempers, may ſomewhat appear. Since therefore of late years, within a ſhort tract of time, three popular Diſeaſes have ſpread in theſe Countrys, I will add, as a Crown to this work, the ſeveral Deſcriptions of them, made at thoſe times, when theſe Feavers raged.</p>
                     <div type="section">
                        <head>A Deſcription of an Epidemical Feaver, ſpreading about Autumn, in the Year <hi>1657.</hi> taken in the middle of <hi>September.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WHilſt we meditate the Deſcription of a Feaver, at this time cruelly raging, it is fit, that following the example of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> we firſt conſider the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going conſtitution of the Year, its intemperance and exceſs of qualities. For Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Diſeaſes, and commonly excited among the people, are from a common cauſe; ſuch as the habit of the year, and by that means contracted, a diſpoſition of the Blood, by which many are alike affected. But that we may draw the matter from the beginning, the laſt Spring, and the time ſucceeding it, even to the end of the Summer, was all that half years ſpace extremely dry and hot, but eſpecially after the Summer ſolſtice, the heats were ſo intenſe for many weeks following, that day and night there was none that did not complain of the heat of the Air, and were almoſt in a continual ſweat, and were not able to breath freely: About the Calends of <hi>July,</hi> this Feaver, at firſt ſporadical or particulat, began to break forth in ſome places, that perhaps one or two were taken in the ſame City or Village: In many it imitated the likeneſs of an intermitting Tertian, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fits returned every other day; which yet infeſted the ſick with a moſt intenſe heat, without any cold or ſhivering going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; Vomiting and Choleric Stools plentifully hapned to moſt, ſweat ſucceeding but difficultly, and often-interrupted, whereby the feaveriſh fit rarely ended in a remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but that all the time between, the ſick continued languiſhing and weak, with thirſt and reſtleſsneſs; in ſome, when the buſineſs began to grow better, affer three or four fits, cold and ſhivering began the fits, and the Feaver became an exact inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Tertain: But in moſt, the Feaver ſtill grew worſe, and preſently became of an evil nature, and difficult Cure, with a depraved proviſion of ſymptoms; for when the ſick were highly heated in their fits, and hardly ſweated, they were wont to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit errors, which daily increaſed the ſtrength of the Diſeaſe, becauſe by reaſon of the inpatience of the ſiek, and the unskilfulneſs of Servants, the ſweat being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, which ſhould have ended the fit of the Feaver, after one fit was ſcarce finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, another preſently ſucceeded, and ſo the Diſeaſe was wont to have wandring and uncertain periods, without any intermiſſion between, and afterwards to paſs into a kind of continual Feaver. The condition of which, ſometimes being very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, with an evil affection of the Brain and nervous ſtock, ſo that oftentimes a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, or Delirium, or not ſeldom cramps, and and Convulſive motions, were excited: About the month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> this Feaver began to ſpread far and near, among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that in every Region and Village many were ſick of it; but it was much more frequent in the Country, and ſmaller Villager, than in cities or Towns. It was ſtill like an intermitting Feaver, unleſs that it ſeemed more infeſtous than that is wont, and with more cruel fits, and ſhorter intermiſſions, and therefore was called
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:107016:90"/>the new Diſeaſe: beſides, it underwent the note of a certain malignity, and gave knowledg of its Contagion and Deadlineſs; inſomuch, that it crept from houſe to houſe, infected with the ſame evil, moſt of the ſame Family, and eſpecially thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly converſing with the ſick; yea, old Men, and Men of ripe Age, it ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly took away.</p>
                        <p>If you reſpect the nature and eſſence of the Diſeaſe, this Feaver properly ſhould be referred to the rank of intermitting Feavers, for the fits returned at ſet times, alſo for the moſt part they began with cold and ſhivering, and ofteneſt with vomiting, and by and by a moſt intenſe heat proceeding, they were finiſhed at laſt with a ſweat. The Urine in moſt appeared of a flame colour, thin in the fits, with ſome hypoſtaſis, without it more thick, and with a rediſh ſediment; altho with a moſt copious ſweat, and often iterated, the Diſeaſe was not cured, which might be expected in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Feaver; yea, the diftemper continued exceeding long, for many days, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times months, tho much evacuation almoſt daily hapned by vomit and ſweat: which we obſerve frequently in an intermitting Feaver, rarely to happen in a continual; out of the fit, at any time of the Diſeaſe a purge was profitably inſtituted, which in a Synochus before the ſign of concoction, were a wicked thing to attempt; beſides, that this Feaver was of the intermitting kind, it ſeems to appear from hence, becauſe very many recovered of it, that ſcarce one of a thouſand died, which I ſcarce every knew in an Epidemical Synochus. About the firſt beginnings of this Diſeaſe, it appeared very like to an intermitting Tertian, altho afterwards in ſome, by reaſon of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious proviſion of their body, and errors committed in Dyet, and ſweating, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to change into a continual; for in whom the fits were not rightly concluded, nor ended in a remiſſion, by reaſon of the morbific matter not being throughly diſperſed, their Blood was continually hot: from whence it came to paſs, that the fits ſooner returned, and continued longer; till at length, by reaſon of the plenty of matter, and the languiſhment of Nature, the Blood being made weaker, endeavoured no longer to ſwell up, and to ſeparate the feaveriſh matter at ſet hours, but to ſubdue it by little and little, with a continual effervency.</p>
                        <p>We are to inquire concerning the cauſes of this Diſeaſe, what may be the leading, evident, and conjunct cauſe, <hi>viz.</hi> by the means of which it ſpread ſo generally, and became Epidemical through all <hi>England;</hi> by what means, and for what occaſion, it was wont to be excited in all men: and laſtly, what kind of alteration of the Blood and humors, being induced, brought forth this kind of Feaver, with ſuch a proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſymptoms, and conſerved it in the Act.</p>
                        <p>I know it is eaſie to place wholly the cauſe of this ſo popular Diſeaſe in the malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant conſitution of the Air, to wit, that the Particles of the Air, in which we breath, were infected by a certain extraneous Infection, and not agreeable to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the little bodies of which Infections being admitted within, did ferment with the Blood and humors, and ſo in moſt, brought in this Feaver, almoſt with the ſame appearance of ſymptoms. For who dares deduce the original of a Diſeaſe ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nearlly raging, from a leſs public fountain? or refer to any other place, the received cauſes of Diſeaſes, than to that neſt of Vital Air, on which every one ſeeds? But whilſt I more attentively conſider the thing, it ſeems to me, that its ſtem, and as it were its firſt beginnings, are to be ſought a little deeper. To wit, that this Leaver is born not from the Contagion communicated by the Air, and immediately fixing its evil on men, but rather from a certain feaveriſh prediſpoſition or nature, impreſſed ſomewhile before on our Bodies, becauſe of the intemperance of the Year, which at length having gotten maturity, on the leaſt ocaſion is brought into Act, and ſo breks not forth into this Feaver, ſo much as it ſifts it forth.</p>
                        <p>For when about the Calends of <hi>July,</hi> the Air was immoderately hot, with a moſt intenſe heat for many days, it caſily altered our Blood towards an hot and bilous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, by which (as in wine growing more hot than it ſhould do) the ſweet part, and the ſpirituous was much conſumed, in the mean time, the Saline and Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous was too much carried forth, that by that means, the Liquor eaſily contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted a rancor or ſourneſs: We have in another place ſhewn, that this kind of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Blood, whereby indeed it turns from a ſweet and ſpirituous temper, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bilous or choleric, is moſt apt for intermitting Feavers: Hence the alible juice, which is continually carried into the maſs of Blood, is not rightly concocted, nor aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimilated into Blood, but perverted as it were into an extraneous and fermentative matter: which ariſing to a fulneſs in the boſom of the Blood it ſelf, and growing
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:107016:90"/>turgid according to its increaſe at ſet periods, as we have already ſhewn, induces the fits of the intermitting Feaver: when therefore, fore the great burning heat of this Summer, the Blood almoſt of all men, becoming more hot than uſual, was very much ſcorched, it is no wonder, if from thence it ſhould contract a great aptitude for intermitting Feavers. But why not whilſt the ſervor of the Heaven was yet urgent, but a little aſter, this Diſeaſe ſpread it ſelf, the reaſon is, becauſe this indiſpoſition is not impreſſed on our Blood at once, or at one time, but by little and little, and not but of a long time; and therefore, Diſeaſes like Fruits, are chiefly ripened in Autumn, after the foregoing heat of the Summer.</p>
                        <p>This aptitude or feaveriſh diſpoſition, all do not contract alike; thoſe whoſe Blood is of a more hot Nature, and abounds more in Sulphur, and for that cauſe is ſooner ſcorched, alſo ſuch who labour, or ſtay long in the heat of the ſun, and open Air, by reaſon of their Blood being more remarkably torrified, more eaſily fell into this Diſeaſe; wherefore, at firſt, it chiefly raged among Husbandmen in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try: of theſe, who had acquired an aptitude to this Feaver, from the Blood being before ſcorched, ſome perhaps fell into this of their own accord, the feaveriſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition being leiſurely carried forth to a maturity; others, by reaſon of a light occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or evident cauſe, which was wont otherways to ſtir up the feaveriſh burning, as from taking Cold, Surfeit, drinking of Wine, and the like; and others fell ſick from the Contagion received of others, for as the <hi>effluvia</hi> conſtantly came away from the ſick, when they pierced Bodies prediſpoſed to the like diſtemper, they eaſily excited the hhid powers into Act.</p>
                        <p>As to the third Propoſition, to wit, that the conjunct cauſe of this Diſeaſe, and its formal Reaſon, may be known, we muſt put you in mind of thoſe things, which we have elſewhere delivered concerning the nature of intermitting Feavers; for we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the retorrid and bilous conſtitution of the Blood, as the baſis of the Diſeaſe, by reaſon of which, the alible juice, being ſupplied daily, as it were in a certain meaſure, is not rightly concocted, but by the aſſation or ſcorching, becomes or goes into a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative matter, not miſcible with the Blood. When the Blood is filled to a full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with this matter (which happens at ſet intervals of times, becauſe the alible juice is ſupplied as it were by a ſet meaſure) it of its own accord conceives a ſwelling up, and the growing hot or efferveſcency being excited, for the carrying away of this matter, cauſes the feaveriſh fit. which ſo long indures, till this feaveriſh matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inkindled, and as it were burnt in the heart, is wholly diſſipated with ſweat.</p>
                        <p>From theſe things premiſed, it is made plain, that in the diſtemper, we now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of, there are ſome things happen by a peculiar way, from the common kind of intermitting Feavers, and therefore it was noted, and that not undeſervedly, with the appellation of a New Feaver; which are, Firſt, That about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, fits did a long while afflict the ſick, without cold or ſhaking, but with a moſt intenſe heat, thirſt, and cruel vomiting; by which, the ſweat hardly, and for the moſt part partial, and often interrupted, ſucceeded, whereby the fit was not finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but of a long time. The reaſon of which, may be only laid upon the very cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leric diſpoſition of the Blood, and being above meaſure ſcorched: For this proceeding from the domineering Sulphur, wholly inhibits the wonted ſourneſs of the Blood, which follows its turgency or ſweeling up, and is wont to ſtir up the cold or ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and by reaſon of this kind of temper of the Blood, too much roaſting and as it were burning the alible juice, the Blood growing turgid, together with that juice, and being ſtirred up into motion, is inkindled more than it is wont in the heart, and by its deflagration, induces a moſt intenſe and troubleſome heat, with thirſt, to the ſick. Cholerick vomitings, happen not only at the beginning, but in the middle of the fit, by reaſon of the abundance of choler, with which, the Choleduct Veſſels being too much filled, infuſe the inteſtines; which then a Convulſion being ſtirred up, is eaſily emptied into the Ventricle: ſweat hardly ſucceeds, becauſe the bile abounds more than the ſerum, wherefore the feaveriſh matter being burnt, it is not eaſily ſiſted forth by ſweat, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either mingled with the Blood, cauſe the long effervency, or being carried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the inteſtines; produces Vomiting, or a Flux. Secondly, This Feaver differs from the vulgar intermitting Feaver, becauſe after the fit was ended, there was no full intermiſſion, even to a remiſſion, but the ſick ſtill remained languiſhing and thirſty; and as to appetie, ſleep, and other accidents, very ill: which indeed hapned, becauſe, by the intenſe heat of the fit, more of the Blood and feaveriſh matter is inkindled, than that its recrements remaining after its deflagration, are able preſently to be diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:107016:91"/>eſpecially, becauſe the ſweat, by reaſon of the dryneſs of the matter, very hardly ſucceeds, nor is the feaveriſh matter enough diluted with the ſerous <hi>Latex,</hi> to be ſifted forth; wherefore, the Blood by its Contagion, in the time of the fit, not being perfectly freed, grows hot ſtill, neither the fit being ended, doth it get any full truce from the Diſeaſe: In the mean time, whilſt the Blood is urged after this manner, with almoſt a continual effervency, it differs from a Synochus; becauſe in this, the Sulphureous part of the Blood, being too much carried forth, and as it were inflamed, cauſes the Feaver by its deflagration; but the continual ebullition, which after this manner comes upon this intermitting Feaver, wholly depends upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of the not miſcible matter, and its hard ſecretion from the Blood. The Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus happens like Wine growing hot of its own accord, by reaſon of its richneſs, the other conceives its fury, like the ſame Wine, by reaſon of ſome heterogeneous thing poured to it: wherefore we remark, that whilſt our Feaver is ſeen ſtill to be continual, it is not cured by ſweat or the Flux of the Belly; altho they frequently and copiouſly happen: becauſe it depending upon the Blood being depauperated, rather than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inflamed, it continues long, and diſpoſes the ſick towards a Cachexie,</p>
                        <p n="3">3. There is a third reaſon of difference, by which this Feaver may be diſtinguiſhed from the common rank of intermitting Feavers, and it is this, that it is eaſily propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to others by Contagion; the reaſon of which is, becauſe here very many bodies are prediſpoſed after the ſame manner, towards the ſame diſtemper, hich happens not at another time; wherefore, the meer effluvias from a diſeaſed Body, are able to excite the like effect, in a very fit ſubject; even as ſome Beams of Flame enkindle Flame, in a very combuſtible matter: In the mean time all do not alike contract the Infection of this Feaver, but that ſome being leſs prepared or fitted for it, converſe with the ſick without harm.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. There is another ſymptom occurs, not conſtant to this Feaver, but only hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in ſome places, that diſcriminates it not only from the common, but varies its own proper type; to wit, ſometimes it happens, this Diſeaſe to be accompanied with a Dyſenterick diſtemper; in ſome cholerick Vomits, and bilous Stools very much infeſt, and in others Bloody Stools follow, with cruel pains and torments of the Belly. The former I often obſerved in our Neigbourhood, and the reaſon of it may be deduced from the highly bilous temper of the Blood: For by reaſon of this, the aduſt matter, not to be diſſipated by ſweat, is copiouſly ſifted into the Liver; then by reaſon of the choler-carrying Veſſels, being filled to a flowing over, it is ſent away to the Ventricle, and Inteſtines. The other Dyſenterical diſtemper, was found only in ſome places, and there peculiar rather than common, it laid hold only of ſome ſick. The origine of it may be referred to the peculiar diſpoſitions of ſome Bodies, or viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous proviſion, alſo to the ſite of the place, or condition of the Air; then the Diſeaſe is to be ſuſpected, to be thence tranſlated to others, not without the communication of a certain Infection.</p>
                        <p>There is to be had a double Prognoſtication concerning this Diſeaſe: Firſt, of the Feaver in General, what end it ſhall have, and when; what it may threaten to the Land: whether it precede not (which is commonly feared) the Plague, or Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Sickneſſes. Secondly, The ſigns ought to be laid down, whereby we are wont to preſage health, or danger, in the various caſes of the ſick.</p>
                        <p>As to the Firſt, Becauſe we have ſhown that the Origine of this diſtemper is not to be fetched from the Contagion of the Air, or its being infected with any venomous Infection, nor from-any malignant ſeeds of Vapours diffuſed through the Air, but only from the ſignal bilous temper or diſpoſition of our Bodies, with the Blood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made aduſt and roaſted extremely, by reaſon of the Summer heats, I think there is no reaſon of fear, that this Feaver ſhould be carried forth into any thing worſe, by the vice of the Air, or might at length grow to be Malignant or Peſtilential. But rather (that the ſeaſon of the Year being changed, and the alteration of our Blood aſſuredly to be expected) we might fear leſt this Feaver, which now imitates the way of an intermitting Feaver, ſhould afterwards paſs into a Quartane, the Blood growing into a melancholy temper. Which thing indeed I obſerved to happen to ſome already, and I believe, that before the Autumn be fully paſſed over, will happen to many more.</p>
                        <p>As to the particular Prognoſtication, the chiefly notable ſigns, which occur in the courſe of this Feaver, and in a manner foretel its condition and event, and of this ſort; if the Diſeaſe happens in a firm Body, well tempered, and eaſily perſpirable;
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:107016:91"/>if vomiting with eaſe ſucceeds, and that the Belly be looſe: if the fit begins with a light ſhivering, and afterwards a moderate heat, with ſweat concludes it, and that the intermiſſion be with ſome tolerable remiſſion; if the Pulſe be ſtrong, the Urine of a flame colour, clear, and with a laudable hypoſtaſis, we may Predict that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe will quickly end without any danger. But if this Feaver be excited in a fat Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of a vitious habit, if with troubleſome vomiting, an intolerable thirſt, and fierce heat, long exerciſe the ſick; if to the heat a difficult ſweat, and partial, and often interrupted, and between frequent vomitings ſucceed, and that it ends not in a remiſſion, we may declare, that this Diſeaſe may be long, and of a dangerous iſſue. But if the ſick remain in ſtrength, and the Urine ſhew ſigns of concoction, we need not deſpair of health; eſpecially, if after four or five periods, the Diſeaſe, as it is wont to do, remits of its wonted fierceneſs. Thirdly we obſerve, if this Diſeaſe is excited in an old Body, or others broken with ſickneſſes, or debilitated; if beſides horrid vomitings, there happen ſwoonings, faintings, Deliriums or Lethargic di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; if after many fits, the ſick having loſt their ſtrength, the Diſeaſe remits nothing, but exerciſeth the Blood, with a continual effervency, and that the Vital Spirits are much deſtroyed; if the appetite be loſt, wakings pertinacious, and that they have Convulſive motions, with a weak Pulſe, and Urine troubled, or thick, we judg the matter to be full of danger: yet is not the ſick to be left as deſperate, becauſe the Diſeaſe is not haſty, and kills not ſuddenly, and out of hand; but is drawn out at length, and grants time and occaſions to nature, of recollecting her ſelf, and to the Phyſician, of giving Remedies.</p>
                        <p>The Therapeutic Indications, which have place in the Cure of this Feaver, are chiefly four. Firſt, That the Blood being now ſcorched, and made too choloric, may be reduced to its due temper. Secondly, That the depravation of the nouriſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble juice, and its alteration into a fermentative matter, may be inhibited, or at leaſt leſſned. Thirdly, That about the declining of the Diſeaſe, the Blood depauperated by a frequent deflagration, and made more impure by the fuſion or pouring into it the morbifick or aduſt matter, may be reſtored, and rendred as it ſhould be volatile. Fourthly, That the ſymptoms, which chiefly infeſt in the courſe of the Diſeaſe, may be timely helped, by fit Remedies; that theſe intentions may be ſatisfied, I counſel that this following method be uſed.</p>
                        <p>About the beginning of the Diſeaſe, if the bilous or choloric humor, flowing forth of the choler bearing Veſſels, and being ſuffuſed into the Venticle, cauſe the ſick to be prone to vomiting, let a more plentiful evacuation be procured, by a gentle Emetic in the time of the fit: The opening of a Vein, and Purging, ought not to be adminiſtred, unleſs between the fits: for whilſt the Blood grows mainly hot, or is reſolved into ſweat, Nature ought not to be called back from the Work begun, nor her endeavours to be diſturbed, by the preſeriptions of Phyſicians; wherefore, after the fit being paſt, and the ſweat throughly finiſhed, a Purging may be inſtituted, by a gentle Cathartic, and the ſame afterwards ſometimes repeated, on the like occaſion: for by this method, not only the proviſion of the excrementitious matter, is brought away; from the firſt paſſages, but chiefly the choler-bearing Veſſels being emptied, the choler is copiouſly drawn forth from the maſs of Blood, and by that means the Blood is reſtored to its natural Craſis or diſpoſition. The Letting of Blood, if is be indicated, ſhould be performed preſently after the beginning; for ſo its Liquor being too turgent of ſwelling up, is eventilated, whereby both the nutritious juice is leſs perverted, and the fiturging, it burns forth with a leſs heat, together with the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bifick matter: but otherwiſe, if a Vein be opened after a long ſickneſs, when the Blood being made poorer, and more watry, more of the morbific matter is heaped together, and does not rightly concoct, and ſilt it forth, it detracts much from the ſtrength of Nature, and nothing from the power of the Diſeaſe. In the interval of the fits, when there is no place for opening a Vein, nor Purging, let the Belly be kept looſe, by the conſtant uſe of Clyſters; alſo digeſtive Remedies, of acetous or ſaline Liquors and Powders, are to be exhibited; of which ſort are, Cream of Tartar, fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salts of Herbs, Tartar Vitriolate, Harts-horn burnt, Spirit of Vitriol, and Salt, &amp;c. for theſe reſtore the loſt, or ſleepy ferments of the Viſcera, purifie the Blood by fuſing it, alſo ſeparate the morbific matter, and as it were precipitate it: alſo, at this time, between, if pertinations waking infeſt the ſick, and overthrow their ſtrength, it may be lawful to adminiſter anodyne, and gentle narcotic Remedies; but never in the fit: for then they greatly hinder the ſubduing, and ſifting forth of the feaveriſh matter, and draw out in length the fit that would end ſooner.</p>
                        <pb n="168" facs="tcp:107016:92"/>
                        <p>Theſe things are to be done about the interſtitia, or intervals of the fits; but whilſt the fit is urgent, altho the ſick then chiefly ſend for, and call upon Phyſiicans, yet at this time their preſcripts are limited to a narrower ſpace: If Vomiting (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding an Emetic being given) ſtill infeſt, it may be more freely provoked, either by ſimple Poſſet Drink, or with bitter Herbs boyled in it: But let the chiefeſt means of help be, in temperating the heat and thirſt, which moſt grievouſly torments the ſick in this Feaver: For whilſt the Blood growing hot, with the morbific matter, and being inkindled in the Heart, leaps forth into the Lungs, flirs up there a cruel Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, which requires a profuſion of a cold humor as it were for the extinguiſhing the Flame; wherefore they greedily deſire without any meaſure drink, for want of which the ſick are almoſt killed with too great heat, and their Blood being almoſt wholly rarified into flame and fume, the thrid of Circulation is hardly continued; wherefore, drink ought to be wholly granted, to thoſe in Feavers: which however, if it be taken in too large a quantity, it at firſt more diſturbs the eſtuating Blood, and at length brings confuſion to the feaveriſh matter, begun to be ſeparated; that from thence, the Work of ſubaction and ſecretion is longer protacted, and the fit is made longer: alſo, beſides, large drinking cauſes troubles in the Ventricle, and by diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and often provoking Vomiting, hinders the breathing forth, and calls inward the ſweat breaking forth, or perhaps already broke forth: wherefore, at firſt, the heat of the Feaver being inkindled, altho the ſick be very thirſty, let them only ſip a little, and abſtain from drink as much as they can; afterwards, when the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt, and ſubdued, begins to be diſſipated by ſweat, they may be more freely indulged as to this, for ſo the ſwealing is greatly helped, and the fit is ſooner finiſhed: as to the nature of the Drink, let them take ſometimes Poſſet Drink, ſometimes Small Beer, or Barly Water, and ſometimes ſimple Water, or ſharpned with the juice of Lemons: In this caſe, the uſe of Sal Prunellae is deſervedly praiſed, to be given in every Liquor; for this, with its nitroſity, wonderfully allays the raging Blood, and potently moves ſweats, I have often obſerved, in the midſt of a fit, the ſick wont to fall into a ſwoon, or ſyncopy, to whom preſently they give Cordials or hot Waters that much increaſe the violence of the Feaver, and bring forth more troubles than uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that the fit is more difficultly finiſhed: But theſe faintings, for the moſt part, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, either from a bilous humor ſuffuſed in the Ventricle, or by reaſon of the ſweat ſuddenly breaking forth; and againſt theſe I always found the moſt preſent Remedy, that either a feather being put down the throat, Vomiting may be provoked, or that Liquor being plentifully drunk, a ſweat may be again raiſed up: alſo, in the whole courſe of this Feaver, I am wont never to give any Cordials, or alexiteriums.</p>
                        <p>The Dyet in this Feaver ought to be only ſlender, and not nouriſhing, all ſorts of Fleſh, or any thing prepared of them, are wholly to be avoided; for as theſe abound with Sulphur, they give a more plentiful food (as Oyl poured on Flame) to the hot or enkindled Blood: beſides, nothing ſpiritous, as ſtrong Waters, ſtrong Beer, or Wine, is to be yielded to; but Decoctions, or Broths of Oat-meal, or Barly, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cooling Herbs, are chiefly to be uſed; alſo Poſſet Drink, and ſmall Beer, or Whey, is to be given them at their pleaſure: for by this means, when a very ſlender and watry nouriſhing juice, is conveyed to the maſs of Blood, the ſoluted Particles of Sulphur, burn forth ſooner, and with the leſs tumult; alſo the recrements of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſt matter, are more eaſily carried from the boſom of the Blood: but if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a more rich or plentiful nouriſhment be adminiſtred, the effervency of the Blood is thereby very much augmented, and the Blood is more infected, by the confuſion or pouring in of the aduſt matter.</p>
                        <p>After that the Blood being much burnt forth by frequent fits, and the Feaver being in its declination, remits of its fervor and fierceneſs, you muſt take heed, leſt the ſick at length growing well, fall not into a Cachexie, or Scorbutic Diſtemper: for the diſpoſition of the Viſcera being hurt, and the Blood very much depauperated, the alible juice, though not ſcorched ſo as at firſt, is not however rightly concocted, and ripened into perfect Blood: but by reaſon of the want of tranſpiration, the ſerous excrements, being imbued with a fixed ſalt, are greatly heaped together, and now fixed in the Bowels, now in the extreme parts, bring forth various Diſtempers. Wherefore in a long languiſhing of the ſick, or otherwiſe for the ſake of being ſooner well, Remedies ſhould be given them, which volatiliſe the Blood, or hinder the ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fings of the Viſcera, or if ſtuffed, may open them, and their ferments as if extinct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore: for this uſe, thoſe Remedies and Preparations chiefly help, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:107016:92"/>called Digeſtives and Antiſcorbuticks; with which being timely adminiſtred, I have known very many weak, pale, and as it were without Blood, ſuddenly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a livelineſs and vigor.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>AN equally intenſe Froſt followed the next Winter, the immoderate heat of the foregoing Summer, ſo that no one living could remember ſuch a Year, for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exceſs both of heat and cold. From the Ides of <hi>December,</hi> almoſt to the vernal Equinox, the Earth was covered with ſnow, and the North wind conſtantly blowing, all things without doors were frozen: alſo, afterwards, from the beginning of the Spring, almoſt to the beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the ſame Wind ſtill blowing, the ſeaſon was more like Winter than Spring; unleſs now and then a hot day came between. During the Winter (unleſs that a Quartan Feaver contracted in Autumn infeſted ſome) among our Countrimen, there was a moderate ſtate of health, and freedom from all popular Diſeaſes. The Spring coming on, an intermitting Tertian (as uſed to do every year before) fell upon ſome. About the end of <hi>April,</hi> ſuddenly a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper aroſe, as if ſent by ſome blaſt of the Stars, which laid hold on very many to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: that in ſome Towns, in the ſpace of a Week, above a thouſand people fell ſick together. The particular ſymptom of this Diſeaſe, and which firſt invaded the ſick, was a troubleſome Cough, with great ſpitting, alſo a Catarrh falling down on the palat, throat, and noſtrils; alſo it was accompanied with a feaveriſh Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, joyned with heat and thirſt, want of appetite, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, and a grievous pain in the Back and Limbs: which Feaver however was more remiſs in ſome, that they could go abroad, and follow their affairs in the time of their ſickneſs, but complaining in the mean time, of want of ſtrength, and of languiſhing, a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of food, a Cough, and a Catarrh: But in ſome a very hot Diſtemper plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, that being thrown into Bed, they were troubled with burning, thirſt, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, hoarſneſs, and coughing, almoſt continual; ſomtimes there came upon this a bleeding at Noſe, and in ſome a bloody ſpittle, and frequently a Bloody Flux, ſuch as were indued with an infirm Body, or men of a more declining Age, that were taken with this Diſeaſe, not a few died of it; but the more ſtrong, and almoſt all of an healthful conſtitution recovered: thoſe who falling ſick of this Diſeaſe, and died, for the moſt part died by reaſon of the ſtrength being leiſurely waſted, and a ſerous heap more and more gathered together in the Breaſt, with the Feaver being increaſed, and a difficulty of breath, like thoſe ſick of an Hectic Feaver. Concerning this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, we are to inquire, what procatartic cauſe it had; that it ſhould ariſe in the middle of the Spring ſuddenly, and that the third part of Mankind almoſt, ſhould be diſtempered with the ſame, in the ſpace of a Month: then the ſigns and ſymptoms being carefully collated, the formal reaſon of this Diſeaſe, alſo its Criſis and way of Cure ought to be aſſigned.</p>
                        <p>That the Northern Wind is moſt apt to produce Catarrhs, beſides the teſtimony of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> common experience doth make known: but why Catarrhs did not ſpread, at leaſt in ſome peculiar places, all the Winter and Spring, but only in one months ſpace, and then joyned with a Feaver, this Diſtemper ſhould become Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, doth not ſo plainly appear. I know many deduce the cauſe from the unequal temper of the Air, at that time; which altho for the moſt part very cold, yet the North Wind fometimes leſſening, there would be a day or two very hot between: wherefore, from this occaſion, as from cold taken after the heat, men ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly fall ſick: But indeed, for the exciting the Diſtemper, ſo ſuddenly riſing, and commonly ſpreading, there is required, beſides ſuch an occaſion, a great foregoing cauſe or prediſpoſition, tho the other might ſuffice perhaps, for an evident cauſe, for to diſtemper them with this ſickneſs; for we ought to ſuppoſe, that almoſt all men were prone to the receiving this Diſeaſe, otherwiſe no evident cauſe could have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed its power ſo potently on ſo many, wherefore, it ſeems very likely, that this Diſeaſe had its Origine from the intemperance and great inordination of the year: and as the Autumnal intermitting Feaver before deſcribed, was the product of the preceding immoderate heat, ſo this Catarrhal Feaver, depended altogether upon the following part of the year, being ſo extremely cold: For the Blood being now throughly roaſted by the very hot Summer, and prone to the Feaver before deſcribed,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:107016:93"/>then being made more ſouriſh by the Autumn urging it, and apt for a Quartan Fes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, afterwards being a little eventilated by reaſon of the ſtrong cold of the Winter, and hindred from its due perſpiration, retained yet its Dyſcraſie, or evil diſpoſition, and readily broke forth on the firſt occaſion given: wherefore, when the Blood, in the middle of the Spring, (as the juice of Vegetables) being made more lively, and alſo begun to flower and grow rank, by reaſon of the ſtoppage being ſtill continued, was ſtraitned in its Circulation, and eaſily made prone to a feaveriſh efferveſcency: and as the ſerous Water redounding in the Blood, could not evaporate outwardly, becauſe of the Pores being ſtill ſtraitned by the cold, reſtagnating within, and chiefly falling upon the Lungs, (where it might be moved about, inſtead of an outward breathing forth) excited the ſo frequent and troubleſom Cough.</p>
                        <p>The Original therefore, and formal Reaſon of this Diſeaſe, are founded chiefly on two things, to wit, that there together hapned a greater efferveſcency of the Blood than uſual, from the coming on of the Spring ſeaſon, and alſo a ſtoppage, or great conſtriction of the Pores, excited by the too great cold of the foregoing ſeaſon; that therefore there was not a free ſpace granted to the Blood, flowring or luxuriating in the Veſſels: The buſineſs being after the ſame manner, as if Wine begun to grow hot, ſhould be put up into cloſe ſhut Veſſels, for by this means, either the Veſſels, or the Liquor, were in danger to be loſt.</p>
                        <p>Wherefore, that we may contract the thing in ſhort, the cauſe that this Diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun in the middle of the Spring, having preſently ſpread largely, ſeiſed very many, was not the blaſt of a malignant Air, whereby the ſick were diſtempered, as if ſtruck with a blaſting, but that at this time, the Blood being inſpired by the conſtitution of the Spring, and ſo luxuriating, and apt to grow hot, was contracted or ſtraitned in its motion, and, the effluvias being conſtrained inwardly, could not be ſufficiently eventilated or cooled. In every year, tho temperate, it is uſual in the Spring and Autumn for ſome Epidemical Diſeaſes to reign, becauſe at this time, the Blood being as it were reſtored, flowers anew; and therefore, intermitting Feavers, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Small Pox ordinarily ſpread in this ſeaſon; wherefore, 'tis no wonder, after a great unequal conſtitution of the year, and not natural, when in this Spring, the Blood boyling up more lively within the Veſſels, by reaſon of tranſpiration being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, could not be freely circulated, and ſufficiently eventilated, if for that cauſe, great diſorders follow, and from this moſt common cauſe, a diſtemper greatly Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical ſhould be excited.</p>
                        <p>As to the ſymptoms joyned with this Diſeaſe, a feaveriſh intemperature, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever belongs to this, the heat of the <hi>Praecordia,</hi> thirſt, a ſpontaneous wearineſs, pain in the Head, Loyns, and Limbs, were induced from the Blood growing hot, and not ſufficiently eventilated: hence in many, a part of the thinner Blood being heated, and the reſt of the Liquor being only driven into confuſion, a ſimple Synochus, or of more days was induced, and this for the moſt part ceaſed within a few days: But in ſome endued with a vitious diſpoſition of Blood, or evil habit of Body, this kind of Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, ariſing by reaſon of the ſame cauſe, quickly paſſed into a very dangerous Putrid Feaver, and often Mortal.</p>
                        <p>The Cough accompanying this Feaver with a Catarrh, draws its Origine from a ſerous humor heaped up together in the Blood, by reaſon of tranſpiration being hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred for a long time, and then an efferveſcency being riſen, dropping forth more from the little Arteries, gaping within: for when the Pores are conſtrained, the ſuperfluous ſeroſities in the Blood, being wont to evaporate outwardly, are poured forth on the Lungs, by a proper caſtration or cleanſing of the Blood, wherefore, by taking cold, (as they commonly term it) that is, from tranſpiration outwardly being hindred, the Cough for the moſt part is ſtirred up: And for a foregoing cauſe to this Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the flowing forth of the ſerum into the maſs of Blood, hath for the moſt part the chief place; for, from the long cold hindring the ſcorching of the Blood, or the proviſion of the bile, and prohibiting the breathing forth of the watry humor, there was a neceſſity, that very much of the ſerous humor ſhould be heaped up in the Blood: wherefore, when the Blood flowring in the Spring, conceived an heat, the flowing forth of the ſerum, and a pouring of it on the interior parts, was wont to cauſe firſt the Cough, as the proper ſymptom of this Diſeaſe: and thoſe, whoſe Blood was more diluted by the mixtion of the ſerum, and who were greatly obnoxious to the Cough and a Rheumatic Diſtemper, were cured with leſs trouble of the feaveriſh Diſtemper.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:107016:93"/>the Prognoſtick of this Diſeaſe, concerning private perſons, is for the moſt part eaſie, that one may deliver the event, from the firſt aſſault; for if this ſickneſs be excited in a ſtrong Body, and healthful before, and that the feaveriſh Diſtemper be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and without any grievous and horrid ſymptom, the buſineſs is free from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the Diſtemper is to be accounted but of light moment, as that commonly is of catching cold, neither needs a Phyſician be conſulted, nor Remedies, unleſs trivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and ordinary, be adminiſtred: But if this Diſtemper happens in a weak and ſickly Body, with an evil proviſion, or that the Feaver being carried into a Putrid Feaver, or the Cough growing grievous, induces difficult breathing, and as it were a tabid or Conſumptive diſpoſition, the event of the Diſeaſe is much to be ſuſpected, and often terminates in Death. The common Prognoſtic, that was taken from hence, concerning the future ſtate of the year, conteins nothing to be feared, or ominates any great ill; by reaſon of the unequal intemperance of the year, the great heats, and then exceſſive cold, we might fear Diſeaſes to ariſe from the Dyſcraſie of the Blood, yet from the preſent condition, we need neither ſuſpect any noted depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air, or Infection with poyſonous breaths; that from thence may be had any judgment of the Plague, or Malignant Diſeaſe to be at hand.</p>
                        <p>As to what belongs to the Cure, when this Diſeaſe is more lightly inflicted, its Cure for the moſt part is left to Nature: for this Feaver, when it is only a ſimple Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochus, is wont to be cured within a few days by ſweat: wherefore, by a copious ſweating, for the moſt part about the third or fourth day, the heat, and thirſt, the wearineſs, and heavy pains are allayed; then the Cough being ſomewhat longer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, by little and little afterwards remits, and at length the ſick leiſurely grow well; if this Diſeaſe hath rooted it ſelf more deeply, there is need of fit Remedies, and an exact method of curing, the Feaver growing worſe is to be healed, according to the Rules to be obſerved in a Putrid Feaver: but nevertheleſs with this difference, that, becauſe tranſpiration being hindred, and the ſuffuſion of the ſerous humor on the Lungs, are chiefly in fault, therefore Diaphoretic Remedies, and thoſe called pectoral are of more frequent uſe, for theſe reſtrain the flowing forth of the ſerum, from the Veſſels within, or by opening the Pores convey it forth of doors; or precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it from the boſom of the Blood, ſend it forth by the urinary paſſages; therefore the method of Medicine for this Diſeaſe, being brought into the worſer ſtate, reſpects both the feaveriſh intemperance, for the ſake of curing which you are to be directed, according to the intentions ſhewn in the Putrid Feaver, and alſo the Rheumatic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, which however let it be ſecondary, and not every expectorating Remedy, or thoſe uſed againſt a Cough are to be admitted, but of that kind only which do not increaſe the Feaver: the forms of theſe, and the means of curing, are to be ſought from the precepts, delivered generally for the Cure of the Putrid Feaver, and of the Cough; the helps, which now, by frequent experience, are commonly ſaid to bring Care chiefly in this Diſeaſe, are ſweating, or the provoking of ſweat, and letting of Blood: for the Veſſels being emptied by this or that means, both the immoderate heat of the Blood, and the abundance of the ſerum, are reſtrained.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THE vernal Feaver but now deſcribed, did not laſt longer than ſix weeks, that it plainly was ſeen, that it was only a more light flowring of the Blood, which ſwelling up in the Spring, and at the ſame time ſtreightned in ſpace, for want of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation, moſt impetuouſly boyled up, like new Wine cloſe ſhut up in Bottles, and then ceaſed of it ſelf. Yet from thence, as neither the year, ſo neither our Blood did recover its due temperature, and ſo another tinder or neſt for a new Feaver, was quickly gathered together. Becauſe after the Summer ſolſtice, the North wind ſtill blowing, a cold ſeaſon remained for a long while; ſo that the Fruit and Corn this year, was feared by the Husbandmen, would ſcarce be throughly ripened; but after this, a little before the beginning of July, a moſt fierce heat followed, for ſeveral days: and when the Dog days were begun, the Air grew moſt cruelly hot, that one could ſcarce indure the open Air. By reaſon of this heat and cold in exceſs, the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of this year was very unequal: wherefore, there was a neceſſity, for our Blood to be now fixed, and as it were congealed, now too much roaſted, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from its natural diſpoſition, to a ſcorched, and melancholly temper; alſo it
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:107016:94"/>came to paſs that the Pores of the skin were much altered from their right conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by that means, an inſenſible tranſpiration could not be performed, after the wonted manner.</p>
                        <p>From the time that the former Feaver ceaſed, almoſt to the end of the Dog days, there was a ſtate of health, and free from all popular Diſeaſes; but then a few here and there among the Villages, and in leſſer places, firſt fell ſick; but afterwards, about the end of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> a new Feaver ſuddenly ariſing, began to ſpread through whole Regions, every-where round about us; alſo, this as the other which ſpread the laſt Autumn, raged chiefly in Country Houſes and Villages; but in the mean time, few of the Inhabitants of the greater Towns and Cities fell ſick. At the ſame time, in other Regions, ſituate at a diſtance from us, yea, almoſt throughout <hi>England,</hi> the Epidemical Feaver was ſaid to rage; and in ſome other places, to be far more deadly, than it was about our Country. Perhaps the Idea of this Feaver now reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had not the proviſion of its ſymptoms alike in all places, or was noted wholly with the ſame appearances and accidents: yet whatever it ſhewed in our parts, as to its nature, I ſhall briefly and ſuccinctly add, from our own proper obſervation, or what I had learnt, being communicated from others.</p>
                        <p>About the beginning of this Diſeaſe, its figure was wandring, and very uncertain; becauſe in ſome there was a continual fervor, in others it was intermitting, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by ſet fits; but at this time it hapned to very many, as a pathognomic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, that they were ill in their brain, and nervous ſtock, that preſently from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beginning of this Feaver, almoſt all complained of their head being grievouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered: For a cruel headach infeſted ſome, and hardneſs of hearing, with a noiſe in the ears troubled others, but to moſt was wont to happen, either a ſtupidneſs, and heavy ſleepineſs, with a vertiginous Diſtemper, or pertinacious wakings, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium, and diſtractions of the animal ſpirits. I have obſerved in ſome, that on the firſt or ſecond day of their ſickneſs, that little broad and red ſpots, like to the meaſles, have leiſurely broke forth in the whole body, which being ſhortly vaniſhed, the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preſently became ſtronger, and eſpecially the Diſtempers of the head, far more grievous. From thence a benumedneſs of the ſenſes, and a ſleepineſs fell upon ſome for many days, that they lay a long while as if dying, without ſpeaking, or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of their friends. I knew others to have fallen from hence into a Lethargy, and others caſt into an Apoplexie, and ſome into a Phrenſie, and Delirium. Of theſe, the younger, and ſtrong men (yet not without a long languiſhment, and doubtful recovery) moſt of them eſcaped; in the mean time, old men, or other ways weak and ſickly, generally died. Thoſe who fell ſick with the Feaver, as it were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, with thoſe notes of malignity, were more rare, and the diſtempered were only ſporadically, in ſome houſes only. But the ſickneſs which moſt commonly ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us, fell upon moſt, and tho it cruelly raged, it ſeemed to imitate an intermitting Feaver, to wit, either a Tertian, or a Quotidian: for that the ſick had fits, either every day, or (which I more often obſerved) every other day, which infeſted them grievouſly, and a long while, with cold, heat, and ſweat, ſucceeding in order: but theſe kind of fits, as alſo the courſe of the whole Diſeaſe, were wont to be noted with diverſity, according to the age and temper of the ſick; and with various con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of ſymptoms, and accidents. Yet this was common to moſt of (I had like to have ſaid all) the ſick that together with the Feaver, they were troubled with Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalic Diſtempers.</p>
                        <p>When therefore any one was troubled with this Diſeaſe, (whether the ſickneſs was excited from an evident cauſe, or Contagion, or without any manifeſt occaſion) its coming betrayed it ſelf, by a pain in the head, and often in the loyns, with thirſt, want of appetite, ſpontaneous wearineſs, and heat tho not ſtrong: if it hapned in a young Body of a florid Blood, and more hot temper, the fits wanted the cold and ſhivering, about its beginning, but they were very troubleſome, and ſharp, with long heat: The ſick were often troubled with vomiting, and their head aked cruelly for the moſt part; ſweat difficulty ſucceeded, which being often partial and quickly broke off, rarely cured the fit, but when the ſweat failed, they grew hot again, that ſcarce in 18 or 24 hours the fit was finiſhed in ſome. In the mean time, from the Blood being very fervent, the phantaſie was diſturbed, that oftentimes a Deliri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, abſurd or idle talking, wakings, and high inquietudes were ſtirred up during the fit; but the ſame being finiſhed, in the time between, ſtill a troubleſome thirſt, a ſlow heat, languor of ſpirits, and great debility of ſtrength, with an headach, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:107016:94"/>a vertiginous Diſtemper, for the moſt part moleſted them. It was rarely found, for any to find themſelves indifferently well, as in a common Tertian, between the fits. About the beginning of the Diſeaſe, the feaveriſh fierceneſſes were ſomewhat more mild, which afterwards at every turn, leiſurely grew worſe, and then began with cold and ſhaking; to which nevertheleſs, after a long and very troubleſome heat, ſweat very hardly ſucceeded in moſt, ſo that the fit rarely ended in its due temper. Within ſix or ſeven periods, the ſtrength of the ſick was much caſt down, that being made languid, and weak, they had an hard task to ſtruggle with the Diſeaſe: becauſe unleſs Nature were ſuccoured by Art, the Feaver ſtill prevailed, and rarely or never in a ſhort time, was it cured by a Criſis, or leiſurely remitted; but it brought the ſick into great ſtreights, by its long ſiege, and ſtill perſiſting, till the Blood being by its frequent deflagration made very liveleſs and watery, was unable to grow too hot in the Veſſels of its own accord, or to be inkindled more plentifully in the heart, and then oftentimes, became ſo dead, and wanting of ſpirits, that, being inſufficient for the continuing of the Vital Lamp, it brought in Death. But ſometimes the maſs of Blood being depraved, and made poor, by this Diſeaſe, was able (tho hardly) to continue the half extinct Vital Fire, and to renew it by little and little, with ſpirit and vigor, in a long time: yet in the mean time, after the heighth of this Diſeaſe, when the Blood being made more weak and impure, could not expel forth of doors this feaveriſh matter, or aduſt recrements, by a critical motion, it often transferred it to the Brain; and therefore about the height of this Feaver, a torpor, and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of ſpirits, ſleepineſs, vertigo, tingling of the ears, tremblings, and convulſive motions, with a great oppreſſion of the whole animal faculty, were moſt often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
                        <p>Men of a more cold temperament, or in years, who were taken with this Diſeaſe, altho they were but little feaveriſh, were wont however to be in greater danger of Life; becauſe, in theſe, beſides the diſpoſition of the Blood, not eaſily reducible, alſo what was gathered together in the fits, that was extraneous and not to be mixed, was hardly ſubdued, and difficultly ſifted forth of the maſs of Blood; wherefore, both the Blood was ſtill more notably depraved in its Craſis, and in every fit more infected by the impure mixture: Moreover the nervous Liquor was greatly perverted from its due temper, and defiled moſt badly, by the aduſt recrements continually poured on the Brain. Therefore, when old men, melancholic, or otherways ſickly perſons, fell into this Feaver, they became, preſently after its firſt aſſault, ſtupified, and for the moſt part vertiginous: Tho in the fits, the heat was not very ſharp and piercing, they were however very unquiet, and ſtill toſſing about, oftentimes they talked idly, and at random; after a long burning, either no ſweat, or only partial, and often broke off, followed; whereby the fit was not fully helped, but that in the whole intervals, the ſick were thſrſtly, and remained very ill, with a drineſs of the mouth, a ſcurfineſs of the Tongue, and a ſuffuſion of a viſcous filth. After ſome fits, their ſtrength being exceedingly caſt down, they were wholly fixed to their Beds, or riſe only for a little while, could ſcarce ſtand or ſet a foot before another, to move from place to place, or able to walk: in the mean time, they laboured with a languiſhment, a difficult breathing, a nummedneſs of ſenſes, and a great debility of the whole nervous ſtock: The Urine in moſt was highly red, of a more deep co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and of a thicker conſiſtency, than in a common Tertian: The Pulſe, whilſt the ſtrength was not wholly caſt down, for the moſt part was ſtrong and equal; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the ſick became very languiſhing, it was weak and unequal, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes intermitting; to which alſo, conſtructures of the tendons, and convulſive motions in the wriſts, being joyned, were for the moſt part prognoſticks of Death. Thoſe who leiſurely being debilitated, declined towards Death, ſome little time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they died, lay for the moſt part without ſpeaking, or knowing thoſe about them, as it were ſtupid: and it rarely hapned in this Feaver, that any one about to die, was ſo perfect in their memory and intellect, as to diſpoſe of their Family affairs, or to take leave of their friends. But it hapned to thoſe who eſcaped, from a deep languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and almoſt deſperate condition, not quickly, or ſuddenly to recover, from their manifeſt evil diſpoſition, but lying a long while wavering, ſtupified, and without ſtrength, that Nature at length, not but after a doubtful and difficult ſtrife, got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſcarcely the better of the Diſeaſe, and then recovered ſtrength by degrees, and health lingringly and ſlowly.</p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="tcp:107016:95"/>
                        <p>If the nature, and formal reaſon of this epidemical Feaver but now deſcribed, be demanded, we ſay, that this (as that of the former year) properly is an intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Feaver: for what commonly ſpread bore that figure; altho ſome here and there, more rarely, had it continual, which we ſhall by the way mention by and by. The ſeed plot or ſeminary of this, need not be derived from the air, being infected with any Infection, but rather its leading cauſe is to be ſought, from the undue conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the year, and from thence an indiſpoſition of our Blood being acquired. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in the Spring and Autumn, intermitting Feavers have yearly ſprung up and increaſed; to wit, for that our Blood, like to the juice of Vegetables, is wont to be more lively moved than uſual, and to flower at thoſe times. Wherefore if the maſs of Blood, by reaſon of the foregoing ſeaſon, of the Summer, or Winter, ſhould be altered from its due temperature, and ſhould contract either a ſharp or atrabilous diſpoſition, or of any other kind, its evil diſpoſitions begun before, are chiefly ripened about the Equinoxes; to wit, when the Blood more freely fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting (if that it hath departed from its natural diſpoſition) doth not ſo eaſily ſanguifie, but that it will be apt to pervert the alible juice, poured to it, into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous and feaveriſh matter. When therefore this year, had not very much decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from a right conſtitution, (as not only the Dog-days going before but) that the two ſolſtices, and the equinoxes, were wholly intemperate, it was no wonder if intermitting Feavers, more frequent than uſual, and thoſe noted with ſome unuſual ſymptoms, did increaſe about the Autumn. That therefore an intermitting Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Feaver raged at this time, I judg it not to be attributed to the fault of the preſent Air, but to the irregularities of the foregoing ſeaſon: yet from what cauſes and occaſions, ſome ſymptoms proper to this Feaver, and diſtinct from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rule of intermitting Feavers, did ariſe, will be worth our Inquiry. I have already ſaid, that the proviſion, that made this Feaver ſo deadly, conſiſted in two things, chiefly, <hi>viz.</hi> the temper of the year, now extremely cold, then upon it very hot, then that it had variouſly perverted the diſpoſition of our Blood, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered the pores of the skin, with an undue conſtitution. According to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons taken from either, I ſhall endeavour to explicate the accidents of this Diſeaſe, and to aſſign the cauſes of its appearance.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, We ſhall obſerve, that the type of this Feaver was various, to wit, in ſome with a continual heat, in others with an eruption of ſpots, but in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting, and like a Tertian, and ſometimes (tho rarely) a Quotidian, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the fits every day, or every other day: the cauſe of this diverſity, we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute to the more ſtrong and potent morbific procatarxy of this year, which produced in the Autumn, a more common intermitting Feaver than it was wont, wherefore, in ſome (perhaps indued with a more praved habit of Body) it ſtirred up Feavers ſomething malignant; and in whom it cauſed intermitting Feavers, according to the wonted manner of the ſeaſon, it made them to be noted with a peculiar appearance of ſymptoms.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thoſe taken at this time, with the Epidemical Feaver (whether it was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual or intermitting) ſuffered preſently evil Diſtempers of the head, <hi>viz.</hi> now they were wont to be infeſted with cruel head-ach, now with a ſtupor, or too great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction of the Animal Spirits. The reaſon of this is, that the nervous juice, as well as the Blood, by reaſon of the intemperance of the year, was much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from its due Craſis or Diſpoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> by nature ſweet and ſpirituous, and was become now heavy, and almoſt lifeleſs, now ſharp, and too much pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitive. Beſides, alſo, the maſs it ſelf of the Blood, very much contributed to this evil; for whilſt it grew hot, the vaporous effluvia, which ought to have been diſperſed outwardly, by reaſon of the Pores being ſhut up, were poured up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Brain, and membranes of the head: and by reaſon of this kind of ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, impreſſed almoſt on all, ſweat hardly, and not but partial, and often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, ſucceded in the fits; hence alſo in the height of the Diſeaſe, a perfect Criſis, or ſpontaneous, rarely or never hapned to Cure it; but inſtead of this, if the buſineſs was committed to Nature, the aduſt matter, or recrements ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in the Blood, were transferred to the head, and there raiſed up now the ſleepy evil, now Phrenſies, and thoſe long and ſtubborn.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That the fits ſometimes begun without cold or ſhivering, but with a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome heat, and were prolonged with a difficult ſweat, partial, and often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:107016:95"/>then foraſmuch as the ſame being finiſhed, the ſick began again to wax hot, that the fits were not finiſhed without a long evaporation of a dry breath; the cauſe was, the too ſharp and bilous diſpoſition of the Blood, whereby when it grew turgid, it was ſtuffed rather with aduſt Salt and Sulphur, than a ſerous juice, and preſently conceived an inkindling, without any previous Flux of ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous matter; and therefore for want of ſerum, and by reaſon of the Pores being ſhut up, its deſlagration was continued for a long time, almoſt only with a dry exhalation, and ſcarce at laſt ended in a remiſſion. And therefore the interſtitia of the fits were moſt troubleſome with heat, and thirſt, Head-ach, Vertigo, and other Diſtempers: becauſe the feaveriſh matter, being heaped up in the Blood, was not all diſperſed by the ſeveral fits, but part of it being left after the fit, as it were extraneous and not miſcible, induced almoſt a continual burning.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. It was obſerved, that thoſe diſtempered with this Feaver, preſently loſt their ſtrength and fleſh, that after a fit or two, they panted for breath, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very weak, were not able to ſtand or go, without being led; when it is an uſual thing, in an intermitting Feaver that is common, for the Patient to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lively and cheerful, between the fits: the reaſon of the difference is, becauſe in this Feaver, the maſs of the Blood is both more depraved by the impure mixture of the degenerate juice, and eſpecially, that the ſame is more perverted from its natural diſpoſition, and therefore, when it boyls up leſs out of the fits, it yet ferments not rightly, and equally in the boſom of the heart: wherefore, when by any more quick motion, or agitation of the Body, the Blood is carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more impetuouſly into the boſom of the heart, becauſe it is not there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently inkindled, it both leaps forth of doors, and by its ſtagnation, cauſes the oppreſſion of the heart, and great weakning of the Vital Spirits. By reaſon of this kind of dyſcraſie of the Blood, to wit, whereby it is made more unfit for due Fermentation and inkindling in the heart, alſo ſome Beaſts, and eſpecially Horſes, in the Spring time, are made hard breathed, and very unapt to any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid motion.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. Laſtly, We are to inquire, concerning this Feaver, wherefore it ſpread chiefly in Villages, in leſſer Towns, and the Country, when Cities and greater Towns were leſs troubled with it. It might ſeem that this Diſtemper, ſhould be excited from marſhie Fogs, and other hurtful Vapours, plentifully heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in this or that Tract of the Air: but there iws a better reaſon, for that the inhabitants of theſe kind of places, being more expoſed to the Spring cold, and then to the Summer heats, might have contracted a greater Dyſcraſie of the Blood, and ſo a more apt diſpoſition to this Feaver. For in truth, the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the Country, could ſcarce go out of their houſes, but they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Sun's Beams, or the fervor of the heated Air. Beſides, Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Husbandmen, and ſuch as were accuſtomed to Labours (among whom this Feaver chiefly raged) from their immoderate toyl in the Sun, or open Air, alſo uſing a bad and ſharp Dyet, ſooner acquired an aduſt and torrid diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Blood, and ſo more apt for this Diſeaſe, than Citizens and Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who lived an idle life, and enjoyed wholſome food, and moſtly continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within doors, and in refrigerating ſhades. We may believe this aſſertion, for that not only the Epidemical Feaver now raging, but alſo another of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn before, excited by reaſon of the evil diſpoſition of the Blood, increaſed chiefly among the Countrymen, and inhabitants of the Country: but the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Feaver, which aroſe in the middle of the Spring, depending chiefly upon tranſpiration being hindred, moſtly infeſted Citizens and the Inhabitants of Towns; whilſt ruſtical men, that were wont, by Labour and Exerciſe, to procure a more free breathing forth, remained free.</p>
                        <p>The general Prognoſtication of this Diſeaſe, ſeems only to ominate or foretel, the like evil almoſt to follow this, as followed the Epidemical Feaver of the former Autumn, to wit, (the Augury being taken rather from the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Blood, than from the evil of the Air) not the Peſt, but a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane Feaver might be feared to come upon it. As to the particular Indication, as Signs that promiſe Health or Death, I ſhall briefly mention them; and they chiefly reſpect the temper and government, either of the Blood, with the Vital
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:107016:96"/>Spirit, or elſe of the nervous juice, with the animal Spirit. If it be plainly indicated from the Pulſe, Urine, from Actions leſs hurt, and the appearance of other ſymptoms, that the Blood, as to its feaveriſh diſpoſition, is not very much perverted, from its natural temper; that in the fits it moderately burns forth; and in every Combat eaſily ſubdues the load of the feaveriſh matter, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhakes it off from its company; that after ſome fits, the maſs of Blood is ſomewhat reſtored towards its due temper; that it perverts little the alible juice, and fifts forth, with a more gentle riſing up, what is extraneous, and not mingle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and that if in the mean time, the other ſpirituous Liquor, rightly inſpires and waters the Brain, and nervous Bodies, that ſleep, waking, ſenſation, and motion, are performed well, or at leaſt indifferently, all good is to be hoped concerning the ſick. But if it appears from the ſame Fountains of Indications, that the Blood hath acquired in this Feaver, a diſpoſition far removed from the natural, if it perverts much of the alible juice, and then from its extraneous and incongruous mixture, the Liquor of the Blood is greatly diſturbed, and the Spirits driven into confuſion; if in the fits, the Blood too ſtrongly, and in a long time burns forth, yet doth not truly ſubdue the feaveriſh matter, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the whole, but that by its impure mixture, it is ſtill more and (in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry feaveriſh fit) more infected, and the Spirits being continually conſumed, it becomes poorer, we may pronounce the life of the patient to be in much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Beſides theſe, if the vices of the nervous juice happen, that being altered from its due temper, or being too dull, and as it were liveleſs, little actuates the Brain and nervous ſtock; or being above meaſure ſharp, continually provokes the ſame into Convulſions and Diſtractions; and if beſides the vaporous efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vias continually falling away from the Blood, or the aduſt recrements being wont to be fifted forth by a critical ſweat, ſhould be transferred into the head, and there induce Lethargic or Phrenſical Diſtempers, the hopes of health will be lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and we may fear a very deadly event.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the Cure of this Diſeaſe, the intentions will come under three conſiderations chiefly. Firſt, a quick reduction (as much as may be) of the Blood, and nervous Liquor, to their natural tempers, or at leaſt a prevention of their too great depravation. Secondly, Concerning the right handling the fits of the fick it ought to be procured, Firſt, that leſs of the degenerate juice, may be gathered together, for matter of the fit; Secondly, that what is ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together may be wholly diſperſed by every fit, that thereby the ſick may be better in the intervals; Thirdly, that the Body being altered for the better the fits may be inhibited by anti-feaveriſh Remedies. The third intention re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the ſymptoms chiefly urging, which ſhould be timely oppoſed, whereby Nature, being not hindred, may reduce whatſoever intemperance may be contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Viſcera or Veſſels, may ſubdue and ſift forth the extraneous matter, and at length may recover a lively force and priſtine vigor.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, therefore, for the reduction and emendation of the Blood and nervous juice, diverſe manners of evacuations are wont to be exhibited in this Diſeaſe, about the beginning of the Sickneſs, with good ſucceſs. It appears plainly from Modern practice, that vomitories are of more noted uſe in this Diſtemper, than in a common Tertian: wherefore in a robuſt Body, and prone to Vomit, about the beginning of the ſecond or third fit, it is convenient to give an Emetic Medicine. The operation of this ſeems to be very helpful in this Feaver, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as it more plentifully evacuates the filth from the ventricle, and the yellow bile from the choler-bearing Veſſels; and becauſe it copiouſly preſſes forth the ſerous juice from the emunctories of the nervous ſtock, planted about the Pancreas and Inteſtines, and by provoking them draws it out. Wherefore we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that from a Vomit being taken, the ſick do find themſelves better about the Diſtempers of the Head. A Purge (to whom a Vomit is not convenient) may be ordered inſtead of it, the day following the fit, alſo tho an Emetic have been taken, it may be well permitted after a fit or two: But yet only with gentle and benign Phyſic, let it be performed, which will not diſturb or too much move the Blood. We were wont in theſe Feavers, letting alone Diagri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium or any Aloetic Medicine, only to give an infuſion or Powder of Senna, Rhabarb, and yellow Sanders, with Tartar and Salt of Wormwood; and to
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:107016:96"/>celebrate this kind of Purgation not very long after the beginning of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe: But at other times to keep the Belly ſoluble, with the frequent uſe of Clyſters. Frequent experience has ſufficiently taught, that Letting of Blood is highly profitable in this Diſeaſe: for when by reaſon of the Pores in every one, being more ſtrictly cloſed than uſual, that Blood growing hot, by the Feaver, wanted Ventilation, the Letting of Blood ſupplies the place of a more free breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth, and prevents the reſtrained <hi>effluvia,</hi> from ſo readily ſuffuſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the Brain and nervous ſtock. But this Remedy is chiefly indicated from the very fervent Blood and more hot temperament, nor ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently uſed to old men, Phlegmatic, and other very weak perſons, unleſs perhaps in a ſmall quantity, that the maſs of Blood may be ſomewhat eventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and that the removal of the feaveriſh matter into the Brain, may be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. If it be convenient to open a Vein, let it be done about the beginning of the Feaver, or at leaſt before the fourth or fifth fit, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Blood is made very lifeleſs by the frequent deflagration, and rendred too impure by the confuſion of the aduſt matter: becauſe, if Phlebotomy be made uſe of, whilſt the Blood is highly corrupted, the Vital Spirits, and by that means the ſtrength of the ſick are more debilitated, nor yet is there any thing taken away, from the power of the Diſeaſe, or from its cauſe. There remains another famous way of evacuation, in this Feaver, to wit, Veſicatory Plaiſters applied to various parts of the Body; theſe are commonly obſerved to be ſo helpful, that thoſe that abhor and diſlike very much ſuch a Remedy, by the example of others being the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for them, have admitted them. By what means they ſeparate the Cuticula from the skin, and lift it up like a Bladder filled with Water; or whether they preſs forth this watery and limpid humor, out of the Arteries, or out of the nerves, is not in this place to be inquired into; yet that they are profitably ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred in this Diſeaſe, beſides experience, Reaſon ſeems ſomething to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade; becauſe it in ſome manner compenſates the want of tranſpiration, by the large profuſion of this kind of ſerous Latex: Moreover, this kind of Remedy, as it were opens the ways and doors, by which both the Blood, and nervous juice, may forthwith ſend forth by a proper purging, the extraneous matter, confuſed with them; wherefore, in the Plague, and Malignant Diſtempers, Veſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories are eſteemed very profitable. Alſo it appears by common obſervation, that in this, and other Feavers, frequent at the ſame time, they did prevent the more grievous Diſtempers of the Head, and were wont to help them, if they were brought in before: wherefore, epiſpatic Plaiſters, may be applied about the beginning of the Diſeaſe, for preſervation ſake, to Phlegmatic perſons, elderly people, and men of a more cold temper; and they are wont profitably to be adminiſtred to ſeveral others, labouring with a Vertigo, Stupefaction, or cruel Head-ach, for the Cure of the ſame Diſtempers. But in conſtitutions very hot, where with the defect of the ſerum, the Blood is too much burnt, and if thoſe ſick of the Feaver are obnoxious to wakings, or a Phrenſie, with intolerable heat, bliſterings ſeem then to be of little uſe.</p>
                        <p>For the mending of the temper of the Blood, and alſo the tenor of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcera, at vacant times, when there is leiſure from purging, attemperating Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies have place, and digeſtives, which fuſe the Liquor of the Blood, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate its faeculencies, and as it were by precipitating them, thruſt them towards the emunctuaries: For theſe ſort of intentions, are wont to be given Juleps, and refrigerating Decoctions, ſharpned with ſpirit of Vitriol, of Salt, Tamarinds, or with the juice of Oranges or Lemons; forms of which choice enough are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be had. Alſo for this end acetous, ſaline, and ſhelly Powders are uſed, to wit, prepared out of Tartar, Salnitre, the fixed Salt of Herbs, of burnt Harts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn, alſo the claws and eyes of Crabs. As for example, take of Cream of Tartar drams three, of Salt of Wormwood dram one and an half; the Doſe half a dram, in an opening Decoction, twice in a day out of the fit. Or take of Cream of Tartar dram one, of the Powder of Crabs eyes dram one, of purified Nitre half a dram, mingle them, let them be taken after the ſame manner. Or take of Harts-horn burnt drams two, of the Spirit of Vitriol, what the Powder will drink up, the Doſe is one ſcruple, it is of excellent uſe when thoſe in Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are infeſted with Worms. Theſe kind of Remedies, promote the ſecretion of the feaveriſh matter, and alſo reſtore the almoſt deſtroyed ferments of the Blood, and Viſcera.</p>
                        <pb n="178" facs="tcp:107016:97"/>
                        <p>The ſecond intention, <hi>viz.</hi> concerning the right handling the fits, comprehends more. Firſt, there ought to be inſtituted a right order of Dyet, whereby the more full heaping up of the degenerate juice, for the matter of the fit, may be inhibited; wherefore, they are only to be fed with thin aliments, and they muſt wholly abſtain from fleſh, (or broth made of it) Eggs, ſtrong Drink, and all rich meats and food whatſoever; and be contented only with Barly Broth, or Grewel, Panada, Whey, and ſmall Beer: for that a more plentiful aliment is not digeſted, or aſſimilated, but loads the Ventricle, and being poured into the Blood, diſturbs its Liquor, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels it to grow impetuouſly hot. In the beginning of the fit, and the time of its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no food ſhould be taken, unleſs for the allaying of thirſt: But for the temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of heat and thirſt, Juleps, and cooling Decoctions, and eſpecially ſmall Beer, and poſſet Drink ſhould be granted. Secondly, a little before the coming of the fit is expected, a gentle Medicine may be adminiſtred, which may drive away the fit by preventing it, or make it more eaſie by procuring a ſweat: for this uſe, the febrifuge potion of the moſt learned <hi>Riverius</hi> ſerves well, of the Water of Carduus, with oyl of Sulphur, and ſalt of Wormwood: Or take of Cream of Tartar, of ſalt of Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and the feeds of Nettles, each one ſcruple, let it be given in the Decoction of the Roots of Sorrel; when the Feaver begins to decline, and that the fits are a little more remiſs, proper febrifuges, applied outwardly, often inhibit the comings of the fits. Yet in the mean time, ſo long as the fits of the Feaver return, the ſick are to be handled ſo, that in every fit, the feaveriſh matter heaped in the Blood, may be throughly diſperſed; wherefore, when ſweat hardly ſucceeds, it ſhould be a little excited by temperate Medicines. Alſo the ſick ſhould be kept in bed, with a gentle breathing many hours, nor quickly permitted to riſe; for I have often obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that ſick perſons have been ſtill worſe, becauſe impatient of their bed, they have put on their cloaths before the vaporous effluvia were ſufficiently exhaled.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, as to the ſymptoms, and particular accidents, wherewith the ſick are wont to be infeſted in this Feaver, it is ſufficiently provided for moſt of them, with Remedies, in the method of Cure hitherto deſcribed: again thirſt, the heat of the mouth, the ſcurfineſs of the tongue, vomiting, the looſneſs, fainting, ſwooning, may be referred hither, very well the preſcriptions commonly uſed in other Feavers: but what may ſeem to require in this Diſeaſe a peculiar method of healing, are chiefly the Diſtempers of the head and brain, with the nervous ſtock, which not being time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly helped, may ſoon put the ſick into great danger of life: As to the indications of theſe kind of evils of the head, they are of a twofold kind; if it appears from a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pefaction or torpor, a Sleepineſs, Vertigo, or Head-ach, that the nervous juice is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come too dull, and as it were vapid or lifeleſs, and therefore doth not ſufficiently actuate the brain, and nervous bodies; beſides the Remedies already delivered, and eſpecially veſicatories, Medicines full of a volatile ſalt do chiefly help: wherefore, ſpirits of Harts-horn, and of Blood, alſo the ſalts of them, are of excellent uſe: but if the nervous Liquor be too ſharp, or the effluvia ſuffuſed from the eſtuating Blond, drive the Animal Spirits into confuſions or diſtractions, Remedies of the ſame ſort of volatile ſalt are adminiſtred with ſucceſs in a little ſmaller quantity. Beſides, a frequent letting of Blood, and aſſwaging Medicines, againſt its Fervor, help much; as Emulſions, Whey, and ſimple Water, plentifully drunk; Opiats are cautiouſly to be given in this Feaver, for the Phrenſie being often allayed by them, is changed into a Lethargie, or a deep ſtupefaction.</p>
